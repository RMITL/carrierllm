ChatGPT said:
Thanks—could you clarify a few things to help me draft a complete and useful RDP?

What is the primary user type or persona (e.g., independent insurance agents, carrier staff, internal sales reps)?

Do you want the RDP to include specific technical stack details (e.g., preferred LLM models, database technologies, frameworks), or should it stay at a high-level architecture and product strategy?

Should the RDP include privacy/compliance considerations (e.g., HIPAA, GLBA, state-level insurance laws)?

What’s your ideal timeline for launch or MVP delivery, and is this an internal tool or something you'll be selling to other agencies?

Once I have this, I’ll draft the RDP tailored to your needs.

You said:
1) insurance agents and reps;
2) yes, you can include recommendations on tech stack and why and/or alternatives 
3) yes but just make sure we remain in compliance and are aware of how not to use the system - it shouldnt require sensitive medical data
4) we plan to sell $50 to individuals up $150 per month and offer enterprise white label with custom integrations eventually. To start, just a highly tuned/finely trained carrier placement assistant tool

RDP for CarrierLLM: RAG-Based Insurance Placement Assistant

CarrierLLM: AI-Powered Insurance Carrier Placement Assistant
Introduction
Insurance agents often face the complex task of quickly identifying which insurance carrier is the best fit for a new client. Each carrier has its own underwriting guidelines and criteria, making it challenging to manually match a client’s profile to the right carrier. CarrierLLM is a proposed AI-powered assistant that streamlines this process. It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to combine a fine-tuned local LLM with up-to-date carrier underwriting documents, providing agents with instant recommendations. The goal is to help insurance agents and representatives efficiently qualify new clients and confidently place them in the correct programs and carriers. By leveraging CarrierLLM, an agent can input a client’s answers to 8 key intake questions and immediately receive a scored list of carriers ranked by fit. This not only saves time but also improves placement accuracy, leading to higher approval rates and a better experience for both agents and clients. In the following sections, we outline the system’s objectives, architecture, key components, and considerations for compliance, technology, and business deployment.
Objectives and Benefits
Instant Carrier Matching: Provide a real-time assessment of a new client’s profile against multiple carriers’ criteria. The system outputs a percentage “fit score” for each carrier, indicating the likelihood of approval, and recommends the top carriers to apply to. This speeds up the underwriting pre-screening from days to seconds, optimizing the sales process

.
Improved Accuracy and Placement Rates: By cross-referencing the latest underwriting guidelines, CarrierLLM ensures recommendations are grounded in up-to-date and relevant data, reducing the chance of misplacing a client with a carrier that would decline them
mapfre.com
blog.cloudflare.com
. This leads to higher policy approval rates and less time wasted on submissions that don’t meet guidelines.
Empowerment of Agents: The assistant serves as a virtual expert, augmenting agents’ knowledge. New or less experienced agents benefit from instant access to carrier rules, while experienced agents can double-check edge cases. This boosts confidence and consistency in carrier selection and allows agents to handle a wider range of client scenarios without extensive manual research.
Enhanced Client Experience: With quicker turnaround on finding viable insurance options, clients receive prompt and well-matched quotes. The transparency of having a data-driven rationale (e.g. “Carrier A is a good fit because your client meets X criteria in their guidelines”) builds trust.
Continuous Learning and Improvement: The system will track outcomes (which recommendations led to successful policies) and user feedback. Over time, it will learn from its hits and misses, continually fine-tuning its predictive model to improve accuracy.
System Overview
CarrierLLM combines a user-friendly chatbot interface with a powerful back-end that integrates a local fine-tuned language model and a knowledge base of carrier underwriting documents. When an agent inputs a client’s information (via chat or form with the 8 intake questions), the system performs the following high-level process:
Query Understanding: The client’s details and any follow-up questions are parsed by the LLM, which may rephrase or clarify the query to improve retrieval effectiveness.
Retrieval of Guidelines (RAG): Relevant sections from the knowledge base – i.e. the carrier underwriting manuals and program guidelines – are pulled in real-time using semantic search. This ensures the LLM works with the latest criteria from each carrier
blog.cloudflare.com
blog.cloudflare.com
.
Recommendation Generation: The LLM, augmented with the retrieved documents as context, evaluates how well the client fits each carrier’s criteria. It then generates a response listing carriers and programs ranked by fit score (e.g. 95% fit with Carrier A, 80% with Carrier B) along with a brief explanation for each recommendation. The response is grounded in the retrieved data, quoting or citing specifics from carrier guidelines to justify the suggestions
blog.cloudflare.com
.
Interactive Q&A: The agent can ask follow-up questions or request clarification through the chatbot interface. For example, “Why was Carrier X rated only 50%?” or “What criteria caused Carrier Y to be a poor fit?”. The system will answer by pointing to the relevant underwriting rules (via RAG) so the agent clearly understands the reasoning.
Outcome Tracking: Once the agent proceeds to submit an application to a carrier (outside the system), they can log the outcome (approved, declined, etc.). These results feed into a metrics database for continuous learning.
This workflow is designed to be intuitive: the agent engages in a natural conversation or guided form with the AI assistant, and behind the scenes CarrierLLM orchestrates document searches and AI reasoning to deliver actionable answers. In essence, we transform the static underwriting manuals into an interactive intelligent advisor for the agent’s daily use.
Key Features
Chatbot Frontend (React): A responsive, conversational interface where agents input client info and receive recommendations. The UI will be a React-based web application, possibly embedded in the agency’s CRM or as a standalone web portal. It can guide the agent through the standard 8 intake questions (ensuring all necessary data is collected) and then display the AI’s recommendations in a chat transcript. Agents can interact further via natural language.
Instant Carrier Scoring: The core output is a list of carriers/programs with a percentage score indicating placement likelihood. The scoring considers how many of the carrier’s criteria the client meets and the importance of any gaps. For example, a perfect fit on all criteria might yield ~100%, whereas a minor guideline deviation might drop the score to 80%. This at-a-glance scoring helps prioritize which carriers to approach first.
Contextual Explanations: Each recommendation is accompanied by a short explanation drawn from the carrier’s own guidelines (e.g. “Carrier A: 95% – Strong fit. The client’s profile meets all criteria, such as < 2 traffic violations (Carrier A’s auto program allows up to 3)
blog.cloudflare.com
. No disqualifying factors noted.”). By citing the underwriting manual, the assistant provides transparency. This not only aids the agent’s understanding but also helps in discussing options with the client (the agent can explain why a certain carrier is ideal or not).
Configurable Knowledge Base: Insurance agencies can preload and manage carrier underwriting documents in the system. Whether it’s PDFs of underwriting manuals, product guides, or internal cheat sheets, these documents are indexed and kept up to date. New carrier guidelines can be added easily (for example, by uploading a PDF or pointing the system to a document URL), and updates to guidelines are re-indexed automatically. This ensures the AI always references the latest rules without requiring manual re-training
blog.cloudflare.com
. Each agency or enterprise client can configure which carriers and programs to include, tailoring the tool to their market and appointments.
Metrics Dashboard: A back-end analytics component records usage and outcomes. Agents and managers can view statistics such as the number of recommendations made, the success rate of placements per carrier, average fit scores, and cases where the AI’s suggestion was overridden. This dashboard will help identify patterns (e.g., Carrier X is often suggested but rarely approves – indicating possible need to refine guidelines or model logic for Carrier X). It also tracks feedback for continuous model improvement.
Compliance Safeguards: The system is designed with privacy and compliance in mind (see Compliance section for details). It avoids requesting or storing sensitive personal data that isn’t absolutely necessary for initial underwriting. All user queries and AI responses are logged securely for auditing, and the decision-making process is traceable – critical in regulated industries like insurance where you need to justify recommendations
blog.palantir.com
.
Architecture Overview
Figure: High-level RAG architecture for CarrierLLM. The system employs a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline to ground the AI’s answers in proprietary data. As illustrated above, CarrierLLM consists of several interconnected components:
User Interface (UI): The React chatbot frontend through which agents interact.
Application Server (Orchestration): Back-end logic (e.g. running on Cloudflare Workers or a Node/Python server) that coordinates user queries, retrieval, and LLM calls.
Vector Database (Knowledge Store): A semantic index of carrier documents, enabling fast retrieval of relevant text snippets.
LLM (Large Language Model): The AI model (fine-tuned for insurance context) that generates answers using the retrieved snippets plus user query.
Metrics & Database: Storage for logs, user sessions, and performance metrics, enabling continuous improvement and compliance auditing.
This architecture ensures that when a query comes in, the system searches the knowledge base in real time and feeds the results into the LLM, rather than relying on the LLM’s static training data
blog.cloudflare.com
. In doing so, we achieve responses that are grounded in the latest carrier guidelines and are specific to the agency’s configured carriers.
Data Ingestion and Indexing
CarrierLLM will leverage Cloudflare’s AutoRAG pipeline for data ingestion and indexing of documents. AutoRAG provides an out-of-the-box solution to handle the heavy lifting of maintaining a vectorized knowledge base
blog.cloudflare.com
. Key steps in this process include:
Document Storage: All carrier underwriting documents (PDF, DOCX, or HTML files, etc.) are stored in a centralized repository. With Cloudflare, this can be as simple as uploading files to an R2 storage bucket dedicated to the agency’s documents.
Automated Ingestion: AutoRAG watches the storage bucket and automatically ingests new or updated files
blog.cloudflare.com
blog.cloudflare.com
. It converts documents into a standard format (e.g. Markdown) and breaks them into smaller chunks for fine-grained retrieval
blog.cloudflare.com
. For example, a 50-page PDF might be split into hundreds of semantic snippets, each indexed separately.
Embedding and Vector Storage: Each document chunk is transformed into a vector embedding that captures its semantic meaning
blog.cloudflare.com
. These vectors are stored in Cloudflare’s Vectorize vector database (or an alternative vector DB) along with metadata (such as which carrier/document and page the text came from). The vector database essentially becomes a domain-specific knowledge base, tuned to the insurance sector’s language and content
mapfre.com
.
Continuous Updates: The indexing process runs continuously or on a schedule – any time a document is added or changed, the system re-embeds and updates the vector index in the background
blog.cloudflare.com
. This means the knowledge base is always current without manual reprocessing. The advantage is clear: unlike a static LLM whose knowledge can become outdated, CarrierLLM’s information is refreshed automatically from the source material, ensuring agents get accurate, up-to-date answers grounded in the latest guidelines
blog.cloudflare.com
.
The use of a managed pipeline like AutoRAG significantly reduces development complexity. Cloudflare’s platform handles the orchestration of file parsing, embedding, and storage, sparing us from building these components from scratch
blog.cloudflare.com
blog.cloudflare.com
. In case we opt not to use Cloudflare, a similar architecture can be implemented with open-source tools (e.g. using Apache NiFi or custom scripts for ingestion, a vector DB like Pinecone or Weaviate for storage, and a separate embedding model), but leveraging AutoRAG provides a robust, scalable starting point out-of-the-box.
Query Processing and Retrieval
When an agent submits a query (explicitly or via the chatbot form after entering the 8 answers), the system performs a real-time retrieval of relevant info before generating any output. The steps are as follows:
Query Formulation: The raw user input (the client’s profile details or question) may be quite unstructured if coming from chat. The system can optionally use a preliminary LLM step to rephrase or summarize the key points of the query for better search performance
blog.cloudflare.com
. For example, if the agent says, “I have a 45-year-old client in CA with two speeding tickets looking for auto insurance,” the query might be distilled to keywords like “Auto insurance – CA – age 45 – 2 violations – which carriers?” for retrieval.
Semantic Search: The (original or refined) query is then embedded into the same vector space as the documents
blog.cloudflare.com
. A similarity search is run against the vector database, retrieving the top N chunks of text that are most relevant to the query
blog.cloudflare.com
. For instance, the system might retrieve snippets from Carrier A’s auto manual about driving record criteria, and Carrier B’s guideline about age limits, etc. This semantic search ensures that even if the query wording doesn’t exactly match the documents, we find conceptually relevant content (thanks to embedding-based matching).
Context Assembly: The retrieved text chunks, along with their source metadata, are assembled as context for the LLM. The orchestration layer might format a prompt that includes a brief summary of the client profile followed by a section like “Relevant Carrier Guidelines:” where each snippet is quoted or referenced (with the carrier name). This prompt engineering is crucial – it provides the LLM with the facts it needs to ground its answer.
LLM Response Generation: The core LLM then generates the answer (the list of carrier recommendations with scores and explanations) using both the user query and the retrieved context. Because we supply the carrier guidelines at query time, the LLM’s output is directly informed by the authoritative source content
blog.cloudflare.com
. This drastically reduces hallucination and improves accuracy, as the model is not relying purely on its trained knowledge (which might omit or misconstrue proprietary underwriting details)
blog.cloudflare.com
blog.cloudflare.com
. The result is effectively an open-book exam for the LLM – it has the “textbook” (carrier manuals) on hand when formulating the answer.
Response Delivery: The generated answer is returned to the frontend and displayed to the agent in the chat interface. The agent sees the ranked carriers, scores, and explanations. If needed, the agent can click on a citation or reference to view the original guideline snippet (we can provide a UI affordance for this, given we have the source metadata).
Importantly, this query-time retrieval means CarrierLLM’s recommendations are always based on current, specific data rather than the LLM’s generalized memory. The ability to plug in new data sources and have them reflected in answers immediately is at the heart of why RAG systems are so powerful for insurance use cases

.
Fine-Tuned LLM Component
At the heart of CarrierLLM is the Large Language Model itself – which we plan to host and fine-tune for this domain. Key considerations for the LLM component:
Model Choice: To balance performance and cost for a responsive chatbot, we can start with an open-source foundation model in the 7B to 13B parameter range (such as Meta’s Llama 2 or a similar state-of-the-art model available in 2025). These models can be run on modern hardware with reasonable latency, especially if optimized. Given our pricing model (starting at $50/month per user), using an open model locally is cost-effective compared to per-call fees of API models. Additionally, it keeps sensitive data in-house, addressing compliance concerns by not sending client data to third-party AI APIs.
Domain Fine-Tuning: We will fine-tune the chosen base model on domain-specific data to create a localized model specialized in insurance underwriting dialog. Fine-tuning can be done using techniques like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or full fine-tuning on a curated dataset. The dataset would include example interactions, such as question-answer pairs about carrier eligibility, conversations simulating an agent querying the assistant, and summaries of underwriting criteria. We might incorporate portions of carrier guidelines and prior decisions into training so the model learns the style of evaluating a profile against criteria (without hardcoding any single carrier’s data, which might become outdated). The goal of fine-tuning is to make the model more accurate, concise, and compliant in its responses. It should learn to output a list of carriers with scores in a consistent format, to always provide an explanation, and to refuse or seek clarification if the input is incomplete.
Inference and Deployment: The fine-tuned model can be deployed on the backend. If using Cloudflare Workers AI, we can host the model on Cloudflare’s edge network – possibly utilizing their GPU-backed infrastructure – which brings the computation close to users for low-latency responses
blog.cloudflare.com
. Alternatively, we might deploy the model on a cloud VM with a GPU or an on-prem server for enterprise customers. For the chatbot to feel real-time, we aim for model inference times in the low seconds (e.g. 1-3 seconds for a full response, not counting retrieval time). We will configure the model with a relatively low temperature (e.g. temp=0 or 0.2) during inference to ensure deterministic, consistent outputs for the same inputs (critical for reliability in recommendations)
blog.palantir.com
.
Multi-Carrier Reasoning: The model needs to reason about multiple carriers simultaneously. We have two design options:
Single-turn, multi-carrier prompt: Provide all relevant snippets from various carriers in one prompt and ask the model to output a comparative recommendation list. This is straightforward but could risk the model intermixing information if not carefully prompted. We will use clear separators and identifiers for each carrier’s context to mitigate confusion.
Iterative per-carrier evaluation: Run the model in a loop for each carrier separately (providing only that carrier’s relevant guidelines and the client profile) to get an intermediate “fit score and notes” for each, then have a second step where the model or the server code collates those into a ranked list. This could be more robust and explainable (we get a structured output per carrier), at the expense of extra computation. We will likely prototype both approaches and choose the one that yields the most accurate and coherent results.
Output Format and Post-processing: To ensure the output is easily parsed and displayed, we might instruct the LLM to format its answer in a structured Markdown or JSON-like format (e.g., a bulleted list of carriers with "Score - Carrier Name - Explanation"). Minor post-processing can be applied to guarantee percentages are numeric and within 0-100 range, and that any hallucinated carrier names (unlikely if RAG is working properly) are filtered out.
No Training on PII: We will not fine-tune the model on any sensitive personal client data. The fine-tuning is purely on synthetic or domain texts (carrier info, Q&A pairs). Any personal data entered by users during operation is not used to further train the model without explicit consent, in compliance with privacy principles.
In summary, the LLM is a specialized brain of the system: fine-tuned to understand underwriting context and to work in tandem with retrieved knowledge. RAG greatly reduces the need to retrain the model on every new piece of information (as the Cloudflare team notes, fine-tuning alone would require constant retraining to stay updated
blog.cloudflare.com
). Instead, fine-tuning is reserved for teaching the model how to think in this domain, while RAG provides it the facts to think with.
Workflow Example
To illustrate how CarrierLLM would be used in practice, consider the following simplified scenario with an insurance agent interacting with the system:
Client Intake via Chatbot: Agent Lisa has a new client, John, seeking a personal auto insurance policy. Using the CarrierLLM chat interface, Lisa is prompted to input key information about John. The chatbot asks the standard 8 intake questions, for example:
“What is the client’s age and state of residence?” – (45 years old, lives in California)
“How is the client’s driving record? Any recent violations or claims?” – (Two speeding tickets in last 3 years, no at-fault accidents)
“What type of vehicle and coverage is needed?” – (2018 SUV, full coverage)
(...and so on through all relevant questions, such as credit history if used, prior insurance, etc.)
Lisa provides answers, either through free-text or form inputs. The chatbot confirms it has all necessary info.
Generating Recommendations: Once the data is submitted, Lisa clicks “Get Carrier Recommendations.” Under the hood, CarrierLLM formulates a query and searches its knowledge base. It finds, for instance, that Carrier A’s guidelines allow up to 3 minor violations in 5 years for preferred tier, Carrier B has a surcharge but not a decline for 2 tickets, and Carrier C might decline because they only accept 1 or fewer violations. The LLM compiles this into a response.
The chatbot then outputs:
Carrier A – Fit 90%: Eligible for Preferred Auto program. The client’s 2 tickets are within Carrier A’s allowable range (up to 3 minor violations)
blog.cloudflare.com
. Other criteria (age, vehicle, coverage needs) also match. Expect a smooth underwriting process.
Carrier B – Fit 75%: Likely eligible, but with a surcharge. Carrier B’s guidelines state more than 1 violation triggers a higher rate, but it’s still an approve-able risk. Coverage and age are fine.
Carrier C – Fit 30%: Not a good fit. Carrier C’s “clean record” program allows max 1 minor violation; the client exceeds that. This carrier would likely decline or offer substandard terms.
Lisa sees this list in the chat window. CarrierLLM has clearly identified A and B as worth pursuing, whereas C is not recommended.
Follow-up Questions: Lisa wants to be thorough, so she asks the chatbot, “Why is Carrier C so low? Can you show me their rule on violations?” The system retrieves the exact excerpt from Carrier C’s manual and displays: “Carrier C Auto Underwriting Guide, p.12: Drivers with >1 moving violation in last 36 months are ineligible for Preferred tier.” The chatbot adds an explanation that this is why it scored Carrier C low. Satisfied, Lisa appreciates that the system not only gave a recommendation but can back it up with source info.
Action and Logging: Lisa proceeds to prepare applications for Carrier A and B. She notes in CarrierLLM’s interface that she is choosing those carriers (this could simply be a manual note or by clicking “Mark as applied”). Two weeks later, once she hears back, she records that Carrier A issued the policy (success) and Carrier B actually declined due to an unrelated reason (perhaps an undisclosed issue). She provides that feedback into the system.
Learning from Outcome: The metrics component logs Lisa’s feedback. Over time, as multiple agents use the system, CarrierLLM’s developers or the AI itself can analyze these logs. If a pattern emerges that Carrier B often declines despite a high fit score, it flags that the model or guidelines might need adjustment (maybe Carrier B had a new rule not captured in the documents or the model is overestimating tolerance). This informs the next update – either updating Carrier B’s data in the knowledge base or fine-tuning the model’s scoring behavior for that scenario.
This example demonstrates how the system guides an agent from initial data capture to actionable recommendations, and how the interactive Q&A and feedback loop function. The conversation feels natural and supportive, while in the background complex filtering of carriers is being done using AI and the agency’s collective knowledge base.
Continuous Improvement and Metrics
One of the distinguishing features of CarrierLLM is the feedback loop built into it. We will implement a Metrics & Analytics module that captures key data points from every interaction, enabling continuous improvement of the system’s performance and the underlying model. The following outlines our approach to metrics and learning:
Outcome Tracking: For each recommendation session, the final outcome can be recorded (either by agent input or integration with an Agency Management System). Did the client end up getting approved by Carrier X? Did they get declined or rated up? This allows us to measure the accuracy of the assistant’s predictions. For instance, if CarrierLLM gave a 90% fit score to Carrier A but the application was declined, that’s a false positive we want to learn from. Conversely, if it gave 20% to Carrier C but maybe the client was actually approved (a false negative), that’s also important.
Agent Feedback and Overrides: The system can solicit quick feedback from the agent after recommendations are given. For example, a thumbs-up/down if the agent found the suggestions helpful, or a prompt asking “Did you end up applying to one of these carriers? (Y/N)”. Agents might also manually override the suggestions (e.g. they know a niche carrier not in the system might take the risk) – such cases are learning opportunities where we might consider adding that carrier’s info or adjusting the model.
Data Logging and Privacy: Every query, retrieved snippet, and response from the model is logged with timestamps and identifiers. These semantic logs (input, output, intermediate retrievals) form an auditable record of how decisions were made
blog.palantir.com
. This is not only useful for debugging and model tuning, but also for compliance – we can demonstrate why the AI suggested what it did, by showing the trail of information it used. Access to these logs will be restricted to authorized developers or compliance officers, and any personal client data in them will be handled according to privacy policies (e.g., anonymized or deleted after a retention period if required by law).
Model Refinement: The collected data will be analyzed to identify systemic issues. If certain carriers consistently have inaccurate scores, we investigate why. It could be that their underwriting guide has nuances the model isn’t capturing well. The fix might be adding more context (like additional documents or FAQ data for that carrier), tuning the prompt for that scenario, or even fine-tuning the model further with new training examples. Periodic re-training or fine-tuning of the LLM using a batch of accumulated Q&A data (after filtering for quality and removing PII) can help the model improve its reasoning. Essentially, we plan for an iterative development cycle: deploy -> collect results -> evaluate -> refine, which is crucial for any AI system’s success in production
blog.palantir.com
blog.palantir.com
.
Performance Metrics: We will define clear success metrics for CarrierLLM’s recommendations. Examples include:
Placement Success Rate: the percentage of cases where one of the top 3 recommended carriers ended up issuing a policy. We’d want this to be high, indicating useful recommendations.
Coverage Rate: how often the system is able to provide at least one viable carrier suggestion (if it’s unable to, that’s a miss – perhaps the client is truly uninsurable or we lack a certain carrier’s data).
Agent Adoption & Satisfaction: measured via usage statistics and possibly surveys or feedback from agents. High usage and positive feedback would validate the tool’s value.
Latency: average time from query to answer. We aim to keep this within a few seconds for a smooth experience.
Error Rate: instances of incorrect answers or any AI hallucinations (should be minimal due to RAG, but we’ll monitor).
We’ll incorporate monitoring to alert us if, say, the success rate drops or latency spikes, so that we can proactively address any issues in the pipeline or model.
Audit and Compliance Reports: For enterprise clients (e.g. large brokerages), we can provide periodic reports that detail the AI’s activity: how many recommendations made, how decisions were derived, etc. This ties into governance – it assures the enterprise that the AI is being used responsibly and effectively. The audit trail of inputs/outputs can be crucial if there’s ever a question of why a certain recommendation was made
blog.palantir.com
. Because we log intermediate steps like retrieved docs, a compliance officer could reconstruct the reasoning for a decision if needed.
Continuous improvement is a journey without a fixed endpoint. As underwriting rules evolve, new products come to market, or the regulatory environment shifts, CarrierLLM will adapt. The combination of automated data updates (via RAG indexing) and learning from outcomes will keep the system’s recommendations both accurate and aligned with real-world results.
Compliance and Privacy Considerations
Building an AI assistant for insurance placement requires careful attention to compliance, data privacy, and ethical use. CarrierLLM is designed to adhere to relevant regulations and to protect sensitive information by default. Key considerations include:
Data Minimization: The system limits the personal information it asks for to only what is necessary for an initial quote/placement. The 8 intake questions are crafted to capture risk-relevant factors (e.g. age, location, claim history, coverage needs) without delving into extraneous personal details. We explicitly avoid collecting sensitive data such as detailed medical history, Social Security Numbers, or financial account info in this intake process. By following the principle of data minimization, we reduce privacy risk while still providing useful recommendations
allianz.com
. For example, a life insurance placement might ask if the client has any major health conditions as a yes/no, but wouldn’t require full medical records at this stage.
HIPAA and Sensitive Data: In lines of insurance where medical information is relevant (like life or health insurance), any health-related data is considered sensitive. We plan to either exclude detailed health data from the initial AI interaction or, if included, ensure compliance with HIPAA and similar laws. In practice, this means if the agent inputs any health info (e.g. “client has diabetes”), the data is handled with encryption in transit and at rest. Additionally, our model – being self-hosted – will not share this information externally. We will also provide guidelines in our user training that the system is for non-sensitive use, and instruct agents not to input any information that isn’t needed or that the client hasn’t consented to share.
PII Protection: Personal Identifiable Information (PII) like client names, addresses, DOB, etc., may be entered by agents. All such data will be protected through strong encryption on our servers. If using Cloudflare’s infrastructure, we will leverage their security features (like encrypted Workers KV/D1 for any stored data, TLS for all data transport, etc.). Regular security audits will be conducted. If a client or regulator requests data deletion, our data retention policies will ensure we can erase personal data from logs and databases in a timely fashion.
Compliance with Insurance Regulations: Insurance is a regulated industry, and any tool used in underwriting or quoting must abide by rules against unfair discrimination and unapproved rate decisions. CarrierLLM does not replace the underwriter or make binding decisions; it’s an advisor to the agent. We will include disclaimers that final eligibility and pricing are determined by carriers, and that the agent must use judgment and confirm details with the carrier especially for borderline cases. This helps ensure the tool is seen as compliant decision support, not an automated decision maker. Moreover, because our recommendations are based on filed underwriting guidelines (which are often part of a carrier’s rate filings), the system is essentially reflecting approved criteria, not inventing its own.
Auditability and Transparency: As noted, every recommendation comes with an explanation and the source of that information. This transparency is not only useful to the agent, but also a compliance guardrail: it ensures the reasoning is based on objective criteria, reducing the risk of biased or non-compliant suggestions. If ever questioned (by a client or regulator) why a certain recommendation was made, the agent can demonstrate it was based on published guidelines (e.g., “Carrier X was not recommended because their public guideline says they won’t cover this scenario”). Internally, the audit logs
blog.palantir.com
 allow us to review the system’s behavior if needed and confirm it’s operating within expected bounds.
Avoidance of Prohibited Bias: We will ensure the system is not using any factors that are legally or ethically prohibited. For instance, in many jurisdictions, factors like race, religion, or gender must not influence insurance decisions. Our 8 intake questions will exclude such attributes. The model will be trained and tested to refrain from making any judgment based on proxies for these factors. By sticking strictly to valid underwriting criteria provided by carriers, we minimize the chance of the AI introducing unwarranted bias.
User Access and Roles: In an enterprise setting, not every user should have the same access. We can implement role-based access controls – for example, a junior agent might use the tool in a read-only advisory capacity, whereas a supervisor might be able to input custom data or adjust certain settings. All access will be authenticated (likely integrated with the agency’s SSO if used in enterprise mode) to ensure only authorized personnel use the system. This also prevents any client data from being exposed to someone outside the agency.
Terms of Use and Training: We will provide clear documentation and training for agents on the proper use of CarrierLLM. This includes explaining what it’s for (and what it’s not for). For example, it’s not to be used as a claims adjudication tool, not to be used to give final premium quotes, and not to be seen as guaranteeing carrier approval – it’s a recommendation engine. Emphasizing this helps manage expectations and keeps usage aligned with compliance. We’ll also outline that the system shouldn’t be fed with information that violates any company policies or client consents.
In summary, compliance and privacy are built into the design of CarrierLLM from day one. By limiting data collection, securing information, providing transparency, and respecting industry regulations, we aim to deliver a tool that agents and organizations can trust and confidently deploy. This proactive approach to compliance not only avoids legal pitfalls but also builds credibility with our users (agents) and their clients, who entrust their information to the system.
Technology Stack and Infrastructure
Frontend: The user interface will be a web application built with React. This choice is due to React’s flexibility in building interactive UIs and the availability of rich component libraries for chatbot interfaces. We might use a UI toolkit (like Material-UI or Ant Design) to create a chat window, forms, and modals for document uploads or settings. The frontend will communicate with the backend via RESTful API calls or WebSocket (for streaming responses). Given the need for eventual white-labeling, we will design the frontend with theming in mind so it can be customized (colors, logos, etc.) for different enterprise clients. Backend Orchestration: We plan to utilize Cloudflare Workers with Workers AI for the backend, orchestrating requests between the UI, the vector database, and the LLM. Cloudflare Workers offer a serverless, globally distributed runtime which means agents across the country (or globe) get low-latency responses. Workers can handle the API endpoints for the frontend (receiving the intake data, returning the AI answers). With AI Gateway and Workers AI, Cloudflare provides integration points to call LLMs and do embeddings right from the edge

. This significantly simplifies architecture – we don’t need separate servers for the AI, it can all be within Cloudflare’s ecosystem. Additionally, Cloudflare’s security (WAF, DDoS protection, etc.) helps protect our application out of the box. Vector Store: We will use Cloudflare Vectorize, a vector database service optimized for embeddings
blog.cloudflare.com
blog.cloudflare.com
. This allows us to store the embeddings of our documents and perform similarity searches via API. Vectorize is managed and scales transparently, meaning we can focus on the data and queries rather than maintaining servers. It also keeps data within the Cloudflare environment, reducing integration complexity. An alternative to Vectorize could be external vector DBs like Pinecone, Weaviate, or even a self-hosted Milvus cluster. However, using an external service would introduce more latency (since our Workers would have to call out) and more cost complexity. For an initial version, sticking to the integrated Vectorize service yields a cleaner architecture. In on-premise deployments for certain enterprises, we could swap in a self-hosted vector store if needed (for example, using the FAISS library with a Postgres database extension for vectors). But those cases would be handled on demand for clients with special requirements. LLM Deployment: Through Workers AI, we intend to host the fine-tuned model. Cloudflare’s platform in 2025 supports deploying custom models to their edge network, meaning we can run the LLM inference as part of our Worker. If our fine-tuned model is small enough (a 7B parameter model can potentially be quantized and run efficiently), we might even run it in a CPU setting with acceleration. For heavier models or higher loads, we might utilize Cloudflare’s AI cluster (they possibly partner with GPU providers) – or use a hybrid approach: e.g., have the Worker call an API endpoint on a dedicated GPU server where the model is loaded. Alternatives: If not using Cloudflare for AI inference, we could deploy the model on AWS or GCP using their AI serving solutions (like Amazon SageMaker endpoints or GCP Vertex AI endpoints). Those are reliable but come with additional cost. Another alternative is using a solution like Nvidia Triton Inference Server on an Azure/AWS VM for full control. However, each alternative might affect response times and cost structure, so we’ll evaluate trade-offs. For our targeted pricing, using open-source models on our controlled infrastructure is likely most cost-effective. Embedding Model: The embedding of documents and queries will rely on a vector embedding model. Cloudflare’s Workers AI likely provides a default embedding model (perhaps a variant of OpenAI’s text-embedding or a local alternative). We need embeddings that capture domain context well – likely a general model like SentenceTransformers or a fine-tuned embedding for insurance text could be used. If we want more control, we could incorporate a step to generate embeddings via a known model (for instance, using a small SBERT model hosted alongside our LLM). The key is consistency: we must use the same embedding model for indexing and querying
blog.cloudflare.com
. Database & Storage: Aside from the vector store, we will use a standard database for other data. Cloudflare’s D1 (a distributed SQLite database) or Workers KV/Durable Objects can handle storing configuration (like which carriers are enabled for an agency, user accounts, etc.) and logs/metrics data. For more complex analytics, we might export logs to a data warehouse (maybe BigQuery or Snowflake) periodically, but that’s an offline process. The carrier documents themselves are stored in Cloudflare R2 (object storage) which is cheap and scalable, and AutoRAG will fetch content from there when needed
blog.cloudflare.com
blog.cloudflare.com
. This means even PDFs stay within our environment. Integrations and Extensibility: We foresee the need to integrate with other systems, especially for enterprise clients. Architecturally, we plan our backend as a set of APIs that could be called by external systems too. For example, an enterprise might want to integrate the “get recommendations” function into their CRM – we can expose a secure API endpoint for that. We may also integrate with email or messaging systems if we allow the chatbot to work via email or SMS in the future. Our choice of Cloudflare Workers supports making outbound requests, so integrating with third-party APIs (like a carrier’s quoting API, if one exists) is possible. As a concrete example, post-recommendation, an integration could automatically start an application in a quoting system for the top carrier. While not in the initial scope, our architecture should allow adding such features without large redesigns. Tech Stack Summary: To summarize in a list form:
Frontend: React, HTML/CSS/JS (possibly Next.js for SSR if needed), WebSockets for streaming (if we opt to stream LLM tokens).
Backend: Cloudflare Workers (JavaScript/TypeScript runtime), Node.js or Python-based functions if needed (though Workers likely covers it), using Cloudflare Workers AI and AI Gateway for model inference.
Data Storage: Cloudflare R2 for documents, Cloudflare D1 or PostgreSQL for relational data (user accounts, logs), Cloudflare KV for simple configs/caching, Cloudflare Vectorize for vector search.
LLM Model: Fine-tuned Llama-2 (hypothetically Llama-2 13B Insurance-tuned) or similar, possibly running via Cloudflare’s AI infra or external GPU if needed.
Embedding Model: Similar to OpenAI’s embedding model or an open alternative (to avoid external calls, likely something like InstructorXL or MiniLM-based embeddings, hosted ourselves).
Libraries & Frameworks: We may use LangChain or LlamaIndex (GPT Index) as an internal library to manage the retrieval and prompting logic, as these frameworks provide convenient abstractions for RAG. However, we must ensure whatever we use can run within the constraints of Workers (e.g., using JavaScript versions of these, or our own lightweight code given Workers’ memory limits).
Testing & Monitoring: Tools like Sentry (for error logging in frontend/back), and Prometheus/Grafana or Cloudflare Analytics for monitoring usage, latency, etc.
This stack is chosen for its balance of developer productivity, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. By using serverless and managed services, we reduce the DevOps burden and can scale to handle many agents using the system simultaneously without a complex infrastructure. Cloudflare’s global network also positions us well to later serve enterprise clients in various regions with compliance (e.g., keeping data in specific jurisdictions if needed, since Workers and R2 can be region-bound). Alternatives Considered: If not using Cloudflare, a more traditional stack might involve a containerized application on AWS, using API Gateway + Lambda or an EC2 server for the backend, Amazon S3 for storage, and a service like Pinecone (or Amazon Bedrock for an integrated approach) for embeddings. We decided on Cloudflare for the initial version due to its unified platform approach to RAG
blog.cloudflare.com
 and promising cost structure (as we control our model costs). We remain open to migrating components as needed – for instance, if our own model inference is too slow, we could temporarily use an external API (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) to ensure quality, while optimizing our model in parallel.
Future Enhancements and Roadmap
Our immediate focus is to deliver a highly tuned carrier placement assistant that excels at its core function. However, we have a roadmap of enhancements to ensure CarrierLLM remains competitive and valuable over the long term:
Expanded Insurance Lines: Initially, we might focus on a particular line (e.g., personal auto or homeowners insurance) to train and validate the model. In the future, we will extend the system to handle multiple lines of business – including life insurance, health insurance, commercial insurance, etc. Each line may involve a different set of intake questions and carrier criteria, so we will develop modular knowledge bases. The system could first ask what type of insurance the client needs, then switch context accordingly. Expanding lines broadens our user base and makes the tool a one-stop shop for agents.
Enterprise White-Label Solutions: As planned, we will offer a white-label version for enterprise clients such as large brokerages or insurance carrier affinity programs. White-labeling will involve customizing the UI/UX (their branding), possibly deploying in a dedicated environment for that client (to satisfy their IT requirements), and integrating with their internal systems (for example, single sign-on, or directly plugging into their CRM so that client data flows in without manual entry). We will build an API layer and SDK to make such integrations easier. This could also include custom integrations like pulling a client’s existing policy info from a database to pre-fill some answers, or automatically logging the recommendation results in their system.
Automatic Application Filing: In later versions, we might integrate direct quoting or application submission. For example, if CarrierLLM recommends Carrier A, the agent could click a button “Start Application” that uses the stored client data to begin the application on Carrier A’s portal or rating API. This would move the tool from just advisory to assisting in execution. Many carriers have APIs or at least digital forms – we can explore RPA (robotic process automation) or API integration to auto-fill forms.
Voice Interface: To make the tool even more accessible, a voice-enabled interface could allow agents to interact by speaking (especially useful for agents in the field or doing phone interviews with clients simultaneously). Using speech-to-text and text-to-speech, CarrierLLM could effectively become a voice assistant for carrier placement. This is a natural extension once the text-based logic is solid.
AI Explanations and Justifications: While we already include explanations, we can enhance the system to produce client-friendly explanations that agents can directly share. For example, a simplified version of why a carrier was recommended that could be included in an email to the client (“We recommend Carrier A for you because it specializes in drivers with similar profiles, meaning you’re more likely to get a good rate and approval.”). Essentially translating the technical underwriting reasoning into layman’s terms. This could be an optional output mode.
Regulatory Updates and Compliance Modules: We could maintain an updated repository of regulatory guidelines (like state-specific insurance rules, or changes in laws that affect underwriting) and include that in our knowledge base. The AI then can alert the agent if something about the client triggers a regulatory issue (e.g., “This client’s situation might be affected by California’s Proposition 103 regulations, ensure compliance in pricing.”). This would further elevate the tool from just carrier matching to a compliance checker.
Model Upgrades: We will keep an eye on advancements in LLMs. As newer, more efficient models become available (say Llama 3 or other industry-specific models), we will evaluate migrating to them if it offers better accuracy or speed. Our architecture being modular allows swapping out the model with minimal changes to other components. Continuous fine-tuning with new data (especially as we gather a unique dataset of anonymized insurance Q&As) could even position us to train our own smaller model specialized in this task from scratch in the future.
Scalability and Multi-Tenancy: As we gain users, we need to ensure the system scales. The serverless approach via Cloudflare should auto-scale to an extent, but we will also implement multi-tenancy support (serving multiple agencies on the same infrastructure while isolating their data). Part of the roadmap is robust testing and possibly segmenting by region or client if usage grows (for example, dedicating separate vector indexes per enterprise client for data isolation).
User Customization and Learning Mode: We could allow individual agents to add personal notes or custom rules. For example, an agent might discover through experience that Carrier B is very good with a niche occupation. We could let the agent enter this insight, and the system could consider it (almost like allowing the agent to fine-tune their own instance, or at least to attach comments to carriers that the model can use). A “learning mode” could let the system observe an agent’s successful placements and tailor future suggestions to their style or preferred carriers (so long as it doesn’t conflict with objective criteria).
Each of these future improvements aligns with our overarching vision: to build an intelligent assistant that becomes an indispensable part of an insurance agent’s toolkit. Starting with a strong foundation (the core carrier recommendation engine using RAG and a fine-tuned LLM), we will iterate and expand in response to user feedback and market demand.
Business Model and Pricing
We intend to offer CarrierLLM as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product with a tiered pricing model, as outlined:
Individual Agent Plan: Priced around $50 per month for a single user. This plan is ideal for independent agents or small shop brokers. It includes full access to the carrier recommendation chatbot, updates to carrier guidelines, and basic support. Usage will be generous (e.g., unlimited or a high cap on the number of client queries per month) to ensure an agent can use it as much as needed without worrying about overage. The focus is on providing significant value to even one-person businesses by saving them time and improving their placement success.
Agency Team Plan: A higher tier, possibly around $150 per month, which could either cover a small team or per user in a larger team. This plan would target agencies or companies with multiple agents. It would include everything in the individual plan but with additional features: for example, an admin dashboard to manage users, team-wide metrics, the ability to input custom carriers (if the agency works with niche local carriers), and priority support. We might allow up to X users under that plan or charge a per-user fee that scales down with volume. The exact pricing will be refined with market research, but the key is to make it attractive compared to the time savings (even one saved declined policy could justify a month’s cost).
Enterprise White-Label Plan: For large enterprises like national brokerages, insurance franchises, or networks of agents, we will offer a custom pricing and deployment option. This could be a fixed annual license or usage-based pricing depending on the size. In this model, we can fully white-label the solution (their branding), integrate into their existing software, and even accommodate hosting on their infrastructure if required. The value proposition here is not just the tool, but the customization and integration – for example, linking CarrierLLM with their proprietary data (perhaps their internal best practices or claims data to enhance recommendations). Pricing for this will be case-by-case, likely significantly higher (but justified by the scale and value delivered). We anticipate these could be contracts in the range of several thousand per month or more, depending on user count and requirements, but since the user asked for up to $150/month, it might be that $150/month is per enterprise user in a general offering. We’ll clarify that enterprise deals are negotiated separately.
Cost Structure and Feasibility: The chosen tech stack is relatively cost-efficient. By using a self-hosted model and Cloudflare’s serverless infrastructure, our marginal cost per user is low (mostly cloud resources usage). The $50-$150 price range appears feasible given these costs. For instance, a single agent might run a few dozen queries a week; the vector search and model inference for that is likely only a few cents in compute. We will monitor usage to ensure our pricing yields a healthy margin. If an agent heavily uses it (say hundreds of queries), we might impose fair use limits or offer an add-on if needed, but generally we expect usage to correlate with actual client volume which is bounded by an agent’s capacity. Marketing and Distribution: We will market CarrierLLM directly to insurance agents and agencies. Strategies include partnering with agent associations, attending insurance tech conferences, and offering free trials to get users onboard. The value proposition is easy to demonstrate: we can show how our AI reads all those thick underwriting manuals so the agent doesn’t have to, or how it can prevent them from submitting losing applications (saving them from lost time). For enterprise, we will leverage industry contacts or possibly strategic partnerships with wholesalers or networks that could offer it to their members. Compliance in Sales: When selling to insurance entities, we must also position the tool correctly – as an assistant that augments human expertise, not replaces it. This mitigates any fear of “AI taking over jobs” and rather shows it as empowering them to place more business effectively. We also need to ensure we don’t position it as providing final quotes or guarantees (to avoid any misrepresentation). Our sales materials will include that the carriers have final say, and this tool is to help filter and guide. Support and Training: Both the individual and enterprise plans will include documentation and possibly training sessions. We will likely provide a knowledge base, tutorial videos, and email support. For enterprise clients, we can offer dedicated account managers and on-call support as part of the higher pricing. Training is important because while we aim for an intuitive UI, some agents might be unfamiliar with AI assistants. We’ll provide examples and best practices (like how to phrase follow-up questions, etc.). Scaling the Business: As more agents use the system, our dataset of queries and successful placements grows – this becomes a competitive advantage (hard for new entrants to replicate easily). We might later explore expanding the product to adjacent uses: e.g., a version for consumers (though that moves into B2C which is a different approach), or a version tailored for carrier underwriters to triage submissions. But those are beyond our current scope; right now, the focus is on executing well on this carrier placement assistant for agents and capturing the market with our unique RAG+LLM approach. In conclusion, the pricing and go-to-market strategy for CarrierLLM is designed to be accessible for the target users and scalable for us as a company. By starting with affordable plans for individuals and small teams, we encourage widespread adoption. The successful adoption and proven ROI at that level will pave the way for landing larger enterprise deals and establishing CarrierLLM as a standard tool in the insurance industry.
Conclusion
CarrierLLM represents an innovative fusion of AI and insurance expertise. By harnessing a retrieval-augmented LLM, it transforms the once time-consuming task of carrier selection into an instant, data-driven recommendation process. This R&D plan has outlined how the system will be built – from the underlying Cloudflare-powered architecture to the user-facing chatbot – and how it will operate within the practical and regulatory constraints of the insurance domain. For insurance agents and representatives, CarrierLLM will be like having a virtual senior underwriter by their side, one who has memorized every carrier’s rulebook and is available 24/7. It promises to improve efficiency, accuracy, and confidence in placing clients with the right carriers, ultimately leading to better outcomes for clients (more approvals, better coverage) and for agents (more business written with less effort). We have also addressed the importance of compliance, privacy, and continual learning. The system is designed to respect data privacy, avoid undue risks, and transparently explain its reasoning – all essential features for trust in AI within a regulated industry. By continuously monitoring performance and incorporating feedback, CarrierLLM will only get smarter and more reliable over time. In summary, this RDP lays out a path to develop an ideal system that aids insurance professionals in qualifying new clients and matching them to appropriate insurance programs with unprecedented speed and intelligence. With the right execution, CarrierLLM can become a cornerstone of the modern insurance agency’s tech stack, illustrating the tangible benefits of AI and RAG in everyday business workflows. We are excited to embark on building this system and delivering value to our users while upholding the highest standards of quality and compliance.

These are the questions/intake onboard flow we want to use for the bot to build profiles of the new clients

Got it—here are 8 simple, knockout‑style questions you can use for either health or life. They’re phrased for quick triage, with the why and the docs an underwriter will expect.

Note: ACA-compliant health plans can’t decline for pre‑existing conditions; use Q1–2 & Q8 to qualify/route. Life (and non‑ACA/short‑term health) do use medical and lifestyle knockouts.

⸻

The 8 questions
	1.	“What’s your date of birth and what state do you live in full‑time?”
Why: Age bands and state filings/network availability; some carriers require U.S. citizenship or lawful presence.
Docs: Government ID; proof of residency (utility bill/lease).
	2.	“When do you need coverage to start, and are you replacing or losing any current coverage?”
Why: Effective date rules; ACA needs Open Enrollment or SEP; life requires replacement forms and may limit backdating.
Docs: Prior policy page; loss‑of‑coverage letter (health SEP); replacement/1035 forms (life).
	3.	“Do you use any nicotine (cigs, vape, cigars, patches) now or in the last 12–24 months?”
Why: Tobacco class or decline in simplified products; rating impact for life and some short‑term health.
Docs: Paramed/lab (cotinine) if required; tobacco affidavit.
	4.	“In the past 2 years, have you been hospitalized, had or been treated for cancer, heart disease (MI/stent/bypass), stroke/TIA, CHF/COPD on oxygen, dialysis, organ transplant, or been told to have tests/surgery that hasn’t happened yet?”
Why: Fast knockout for many fully/simplified underwritten life and short‑term health; pending workups often postpone.
Docs: APS/medical records; discharge summaries; pathology/cardiology reports.
	5.	“What prescription meds do you take now (or took in the last 2 years) and what for?”
Why: Rx history drives risk class and can reveal disqualifiers (e.g., insulin with complications, anticoagulants + cardiac history).
Docs: Rx list or pharmacy printout; carrier Rx check authorization.
	6.	“What’s your height and weight?”
Why: Build tables determine class, table ratings, or declines.
Docs: Exam/paramed results; carrier build chart reference.
	7.	“Any DUIs/reckless driving in the last 5 years, felony/probation, or high‑risk activities/occupations (private aviation, scuba, climbing, logging, offshore)?”
Why: MVR, criminal history, and avocations can trigger declines, flat extras, or postponements for life; some short‑term plans exclude.
Docs: MVR authorization; avocation/occupational questionnaire.
	8.	“Household size & annual income (for health) or occupation, income, and existing life coverage/desired face amount (for life)?”
Why: Routes ACA subsidies/Medicaid eligibility (health) and satisfies financial underwriting (life)—benefit amount must match need/income.
Docs: Tax return/pay stub (health subsidies/Medicaid); financial worksheets, in‑force illustration, replacement forms (life).

⸻

Quick disposition guide (use with the 8 answers)
	•	Clean answers to 3–7 + valid timing (Q2):
	•	Life: Fully underwritten or accelerated underwriting.
	•	Health: ACA plan (if in OEP/SEP) or short‑term (if outside OEP and medically eligible).
	•	Yes to major conditions in Q4 or risky items in Q7:
	•	Life: Consider guaranteed‑issue or graded benefit; otherwise postpone per carrier deferrals.
	•	Health: ACA plan (can’t decline for health), skip short‑term.
	•	Tobacco in Q3:
	•	Life: Tobacco class (price impact); some simplified programs decline—redirect accordingly.
	•	Health: ACA rates reflect tobacco where allowed; short‑term may surcharge/decline.
	•	Build outside tables in Q6:
	•	Life: Table‑rate or decline → look at GI/graded.
	•	Health: ACA still available; short‑term may decline/surcharge.
	•	Timing/eligibility issues in Q2 (no OEP/SEP):
	•	Health: Explore Medicaid/CHIP, COBRA, or short‑term (if medically eligible); otherwise next OEP date.

Copy‑paste intake script (1 minute)
	1.	DOB & state of residence?
	2.	Desired start date; replacing/losing coverage?
	3.	Any nicotine use in last 24 months?
	4.	Past 2 years: hospitalizations or diagnoses—cancer, heart issues (MI/stent/bypass), stroke/TIA, CHF/COPD on oxygen, dialysis, transplant, or pending tests/surgery?
	5.	Current/recent prescriptions and conditions they treat?
	6.	Height & weight?

}
10) Scoring rubric (deterministic pre-score + LLM reasoning)
Rule pre-screen (deterministic):

Map intake to carrier rule features (tables for build, tobacco windows, disqualifying conditions, timing constraints).

Produce eligibility status: {eligible, eligible_with_surcharge, GI/graded, decline, unknown}.

Compute a base score:

eligible: 70–90 (start high, adjust by minor mismatches)

eligible_with_surcharge: 50–70

GI/graded: 25–50

decline: 0–20

unknown/missing data: 40–60 with low confidence

LLM justification & refinement:

Provide retrieved passages per carrier + base score + feature deltas.

LLM returns: refined fit_pct (±15% window), ranked list, reasons[], citations[], flags[].

If conflicts in docs, reduce confidence and surface “Check with underwriter” flag.

Post-processing: clamp to [0,100], ensure at least one safe route (e.g., ACA for health) is proposed.

11) Retrieval & model specs (MVP)
Indexing: Cloudflare R2 (docs) → AutoRAG pipeline → chunking (semantic, 512–1024 tokens, overlap 64) → embeddings → Vectorize.

Query: hybrid search (k-NN + BM25 fallback) per carrier; cap 6 passages/carrier, 10 carriers.

Model: local fine-tuned 7B–13B (LoRA) for “underwriting reasoning + explanation style”; temp 0.2; top-p 0.9; max tokens 700.

Grounding: strict prompt template with carrier-scoped contexts; instruct: “never infer rules not present; cite passages.”

12) Validation & guardrails
DOB age 0–120; state ∈ USPS codes; height 48–90 in; weight 70–600 lb.

Tobacco window: normalize to boolean + last use date if provided.

Rx list: names normalized via local dictionary; unknowns allowed.

Red flags: major conditions list; pending tests/surgery → postpone suggestion for life.

Q2 coverage timing → determine ACA OEP/SEP heuristic (no formal eligibility determination).

PII minimization: no SSN, no full medical records; optional initials only for client label.

13) Compliance & privacy
Data minimization: only Q1–Q8; no PHI beyond high-level conditions.

Storage: encrypted at rest; per-tenant isolation; configurable retention (default 180d).

Audit: store prompts, retrieval IDs, outputs; exportable evidence pack.

Bias controls: exclude protected attributes; only use objective underwriting rules.

Disclaimers in UI: “Advisory only; final eligibility/pricing by carrier.”

User roles: Agent, Manager, Admin; SSO for enterprise.

14) UX requirements
14.1 Screens / components
Intake: IntakeForm (form) and ChatPane (chat).

Results: CarrierList with chips (Eligible, GI/Graded, Decline), % fit, and View source popover (shows excerpt + link icon).

Follow-ups: inline Q&A thread under each carrier card.

Outcome logger: 2-click update with status + note.

Admin: CarrierLibrary (upload, parse status), TenantSettings, AnalyticsDashboard.

Evidence pack modal: timeline of retrieval → prompt → output.

14.2 Copy (key)
CTA after intake: “Get carrier recommendations”

Empty state (no eligible short-term): “Based on health answers, short-term likely ineligible. Recommend ACA plan options; consider Medicaid/CHIP if income eligible.”

15) API contracts (MVP)
POST /api/intake/submit
req: Intake JSON (§9.1) + tenant_id

res: Recommendation JSON (§9.2) + request_id

GET /api/recommendations/:request_id
res: same as above (idempotent fetch)

POST /api/outcomes
req: {request_id, carrier_id, status, note?}

POST /api/carriers/upload
multipart; metadata JSON (§9.3) + file

GET /api/carriers
list enabled carriers, versions, parse/index status

GET /api/analytics/summary
placement success, accuracy, usage, latency

16) Events & analytics (product)
intake_completed, recommendation_shown, carrier_clicked, evidence_viewed, outcome_logged, doc_uploaded, index_success|failure.

KPIs: Top-3 placement hit-rate, approval-weighted NPS, P95 latency, retrieval coverage (#carriers with passages ≥3), doc freshness.

17) Testing plan
Unit

Validation rules on Q1–Q8.

Rule engine mapping (build tables, tobacco windows).

Parsing and chunking on sample PDFs (table detection, headings).

Integration

RAG path: intake → retrieval → LLM → output; ensure citations always present.

Sparse docs: ensure graceful degradation + lower confidence & “Check with underwriter”.

E2E

Golden cases:

Health, outside OEP, no SEP → ACA guidance + short-term decision based on Q3–Q7.

Life, tobacco + BMI borderline + controlled Rx → specific program recommendations + table note.

Major Q4 condition → GI/graded or postpone with citation.

Security

RBAC; tenant isolation; SSO login; PII redaction in logs.

18) Rollout & packaging
Pricing: Individual $50/mo; Team $150/mo (per user or tiered—finalize), Enterprise custom.

Onboarding: carrier set import (CSV/ZIP of docs), default rubric, sample prompts.

SLAs: Support response ≤ 1 business day (pro), priority for enterprise.

19) Open questions (tracked)
Carriers/programs catalog bootstrapping (starter pack?)

Build tables ingestion (structured from PDFs vs. human-entered YAML).

ACA OEP/SEP heuristic: show next OEP date per state? (no hard dependency for MVP).

Confidence calibration: display band vs. single %.

20) Acceptance criteria (MVP)
Submit any valid intake → ≤4s P95 recommendations with ≥1 grounded citation per carrier.

Upload a new carrier PDF → auto-indexed and discoverable within <15 min.

Evidence pack export renders retrieved snippets + prompt + output for any request.

Logging outcomes influences dashboard metrics within 1 hour.

For health with major Q4 conditions, short-term is never recommended without explicit carrier allowance.

21) Implementation notes (dev handoff)
Frontend (React/TypeScript)

State: Zustand/Redux Toolkit; React Query for API.

Components:

IntakeForm, ChatPane, CarrierCard, EvidencePopover, OutcomeDialog, AdminUploader, ParseStatusList, AnalyticsCharts.

Accessibility: keyboard-first form; WCAG AA; masking for DOB/phone.

Backend (Cloudflare Workers / TypeScript)

Routes per §15; middleware for auth (JWT/SSO), tenant context, rate-limit.

Retrieval service: Vectorize client; hybrid search; per-tenant index namespace.

Model service: Workers AI (custom fine-tuned model); deterministic params (temp 0.2).

Storage: R2 (docs), D1 (metadata & outcomes), KV (feature flags), Durable Object (sessions).

Parser: PDF→markdown; headings + tables; chunking 512–1024 tokens; overlap 64.

Rule engine: YAML per carrier for simple hard rules; augment with retrieved passages.

DevOps/Observability

Feature flags for “chat” vs. “form” default.

Traces: req_id correlates intake→retrieval→generation.

Secrets in CF environment bindings; rotation policy.

22) Prompt templates (LLM)
System

You are CarrierLLM, an underwriting placement assistant. You must ONLY use provided documents. If a rule is not present, say so and lower confidence. Always return: carrier, program, fit_pct (0–100), reasons (bullet), citations (doc/page/anchor), flags.

User (example)

INTAKE_JSON: {...}
CONTEXT:
[Carrier: Acme Life]
- (p12) “Cardiac history…”
- (p3) “Build Table…”
[Carrier: Beacon Health]
- (p7) “Short-term exclusions…”
TASK:
Rank carriers (max 10). Explain in 2–3 bullets each. Include citations.
23) Example UI states (for design)
Results list: Cards with: Logo, Program, 87% Fit chip, 2–3 bullets, “View source” (popover showing excerpt + page), Actions: “Mark Applied”, “Start App” (external link placeholder).

Empty state: “We didn’t find enough grounded rules to recommend short-term. Consider ACA plans. You can still apply to Carrier X (GI).”

Evidence pack modal: left rail (timeline), right pane (content blocks).

Admin upload status: “Parsing…”, “Embedded ✓ at 14:32”, errors surfaced with page numbers.

If you want, I can also provide:

sample carrier YAML for build/tobacco rules,

a seed set of test PDFs and their expected chunks,

and a lightweight Figma wire map based on the states above.

We need to include the public facing saas signup page with stripe to charge and auth/usage based billing for overages to grant user access  
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 9s
Awesome—adding a full SaaS signup + billing flow to the PRD. Below is a plug-and-play addendum you can hand to design + dev. It covers Stripe subscriptions, metered overages, auth, provisioning, billing state → app access, and admin/analytics.

Addendum — Public SaaS Signup, Auth, and Billing
Last updated: Sep 16, 2025 · Owner: @jay · Scope: Public website + checkout, auth, metering/overages, provisioning, billing state enforcement

A) Public Marketing Site & Signup
A-1 Pages (public)
Home / Landing: Value prop, hero CTA “Start free trial”, social proof, screenshots.

Pricing: Plan cards with features, monthly pricing, overage rate, FAQ, “Compare plans.”

Security & Compliance: Data handling, auditability, SOC2-in-progress badge if applicable.

Docs/Help: Getting started, API keys, admin setup for carrier docs.

Legal: Terms, Privacy, DPA, Cookies.

Enterprise: “Talk to sales” lead form (HubSpot/CRM capture).

A-2 Pricing (display & plan logic)
Individual – $50/mo user.
Limits (editable in admin): 500 recommendation runs/mo, 2GB doc storage, 2 tenants max (personal only). Overage: $0.05 per recommendation.

Team – $150/mo user (or $300 for up to 3 seats—choose one model now).
Limits: 3,000 recs/mo per workspace, 20GB docs, 10 tenants, Admin + Manager roles. Overage: $0.03 per rec.

Enterprise – Custom.
SSO/SCIM, data residency, dedicated index, premium SLA. Contact sales CTA.

Note: “recommendation” = a model run returning ≥1 carrier item. This is the primary metered unit.

A-3 Trials, coupons, tax
Free trial: 14 days, 200 recommendations, no card optional (A/B test).

Support Stripe Tax for US state sales tax + VAT where applicable.

Accept promo codes (Stripe coupons).

B) Authentication & Tenant Provisioning
B-1 Auth provider
Clerk (recommended) or Auth0.

Email/password + magic link + OAuth (Google/Microsoft) enabled.

Issue JWT with sub, tenant_id, role, plan_id.

B-2 Tenant model
On successful checkout (or trial start): create tenant row with:

tenant_id, owner_user_id, stripe_customer_id, plan_id, status=active_trial|active|past_due|canceled

Seed: default carrier library settings, 1 sample doc, 3 sample “golden” cases, and default scoring rubric.

B-3 Seat management
Owners/admins can invite users by email; invitation enforces seat count according to Stripe subscription quantity.

Over-invites prompt “add seat → opens Stripe Customer Portal.”

C) Billing & Metering (Stripe)
C-1 Stripe objects
Products/Prices:

prod_individual → price_individual_monthly (recurring, per seat).

prod_team → price_team_monthly (per seat or bundle of seats).

price_recommendation_metered: metered, billed monthly (post-paid).

Stripe Tax on recurring & usage.

Customer Portal enabled (address, payment, invoices, cancellations, proration).

C-2 Checkout → Provisioning flow
User clicks Start free trial or Buy now.

Stripe Checkout Session created with:

Line item: base subscription price (seat qty)

Line item: metered usage price (quantity billed via usage records)

Trial parameters (if trial)

Tax behavior (auto via Stripe Tax)

Webhook checkout.session.completed → create tenant + map stripe_customer_id, subscription_id.

Send welcome email with “Go to app”.

C-3 Metered usage
Unit: recommendation (every successful recommendation response increments usage by 1).

Worker posts usage records to Stripe:

Endpoint: POST /v1/subscription_items/{id}/usage_records

Frequency: near-real-time (best) or hourly batch with idempotency key.

Payload: {quantity: n, timestamp, action:'increment'}

Keep an internal shadow meter (D1/Postgres) for analytics and dispute resolution.

C-4 Overage policy & gating
Each plan includes monthly included recommendations.

When approaching 80% of quota: in-app banner + email.

When exceeding:

Continue serving (soft cap) and accrue overage at plan’s per-unit price.

Optional org setting for hard cap: require explicit upgrade or overage opt-in.

C-5 Billing state → app access
Webhook handlers update tenant.status:

invoice.payment_failed → past_due (start 7-day grace), show banner + email dunning.

customer.subscription.paused/canceled → suspended after grace (read-only access to history; no new recommendations).

invoice.paid → active.

Middleware checks tenant.status & entitlements on each request.

C-6 Proration, upgrades, downgrades
Use Stripe proration defaults.

Changing seat count or plan updates immediately; entitlements refresh.

Downgrade respects hard limits (e.g., doc storage > new plan limit → block or require cleanup).

D) App Entitlements & Rate Limits
D-1 Entitlements table (per plan)
included_recommendations/mo

overage_rate_per_recommendation

max_doc_storage_gb

max_tenants

features: { admin_dashboard, evidence_export, api_access, sso, white_label }

D-2 Rate limiting (runtime)
Per-tenant: 10 req/min to /api/intake/submit (burstable to 30).

Per-user: 60 req/min aggregate.

Return 429 with “please wait” copy + link to upgrade if consistently hitting limits.

E) Public-to-Product UX
E-1 Signup journey (happy path)
Landing → Pricing → Plan select → Checkout

Post-checkout: “Create workspace” screen (tenant name/logo), invite teammates, import carrier docs.

“Take a tour” (2-min) → first intake.

E-2 Empty states & banners
Trial banner: “14 days left · 143/200 recommendations remaining.”

Near-quota banner: “80% used—enable overages or upgrade to Team.”

Past-due banner: “We couldn’t process payment; grace ends in 7 days.”

F) Security, Compliance, and Tax
PCI-DSS: We never touch card data; all payments via Stripe Checkout/Portal.

Webhook security: verify signatures; idempotency keys on writes.

Data residency/tax: Stripe Tax; collect company name, address, VAT where needed.

Roles: Owner, Admin, Manager, Agent. Owner/Admin can access billing + portal.

SSO/SCIM: Enterprise only (SAML/OIDC).

Dunning: 3-email sequence + portal link (days 1/4/7).

G) APIs, Webhooks, Middleware
G-1 New/updated endpoints
POST /api/public/checkout-session

req: {plan_id, seats, trial?:bool, coupon?:string}

res: {checkout_url}

POST /api/stripe/webhook

Handles: checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.created|updated|deleted, invoice.payment_succeeded|failed, charge.dispute.created, customer.subscription.trial_will_end.

Side effects:

create/update tenant + entitlements

set tenant.status

email notifications

POST /api/meter/usage (internal worker job)

Upserts usage to Stripe (if using batch mode).

G-2 Middleware (pseudocode)
async function enforceAccess(ctx, next) {
  const auth = verifyJWT(ctx.req);
  const tenant = await db.getTenant(auth.tenant_id);
  if (!tenant) return 403;

  if (tenant.status === 'suspended') return 402; // payment required

  const ent = await db.getEntitlements(tenant.plan_id);
  ctx.entitlements = ent;

  // metering: increment on successful recommendation only
  return next();
}
H) Data model (additions)
plans: plan_id, name, monthly_price, included_recs, overage_rate, features JSON.

tenants: tenant_id, owner_user_id, stripe_customer_id, subscription_id, plan_id, status, created_at.

usage_counters: tenant_id, month_key (YYYY-MM), recs_count, last_sync_ts.

billing_events: id, tenant_id, type, payload, ts.

seats: tenant_id, user_id, role, active.

I) Admin surfaces
I-1 Billing admin (internal)
View tenants, plan, status, last webhook, current usage, Stripe links (customer, subscription).

Manual adjust usage (with reason).

Resend dunning, force suspension/reactivation.

I-2 Tenant billing (customer-facing)
Billing tab → Stripe Customer Portal.

Show current usage, forecasted overage, buttons: “Manage payment,” “Change plan,” “Add seats.”

J) Acceptance criteria (billing)
Creating a Checkout Session leads to a tenant provisioned within ≤30s of checkout.session.completed.

Metered usage increments on every successful recommendation; Stripe usage and internal counter match within 0.5% at invoice finalization.

State transitions:

invoice.payment_failed → grace banner within 1 min; status past_due.

After 7 days without payment → suspended; new recs blocked with 402 Payment Required.

Payment success → reactivated automatically.

Customer can upgrade/downgrade seats via Portal; entitlements update instantly.

Trial end emails sent T-3, T-1; on trial conversion, no disruption to access.

K) Implementation notes (dev handoff)
Stripe SDK in Workers (or call via Fetch with secret): store webhook secret, verify signatures.

Use Stripe “metered billing” for usage; one subscription item per tenant for recommendations.

Clock & idempotency: usage records must include deterministic key hash(tenant_id|month|request_id); retries safe.

Background cron (Workers Scheduled): hourly reconciliation—compare internal counters vs. Stripe and fill gaps.

Feature flags: enable/disable overages per plan; hard cap toggle.

Emails: Postmark/SES templates (trial start, nearing limit, payment failed, suspension, reactivation).

L) Design specs (Figma handoff hints)
Pricing table component with toggle (Monthly / Yearly), badges (Most popular), tooltip for “What counts as a recommendation?”.

Checkout screen → minimal friction; after return, workspace setup wizard (name, logo, invite).

Usage meter widget in top bar: “132 / 500 this month” with colored progress.

Banners styles: info (blue), warning (amber), past-due (red) with CTA → “Open Billing Portal”.

M) Risks & mitigations
Under-count / over-count usage: dual meter + hourly reconciliation + idempotent usage posts.

Charge disputes: keep evidence (request_id, timestamps, user_id, IP, recommendation payload size).

Overage surprise: proactive 80/100/120% emails, in-app forecast (“est. $2.85 overage”).

Webhook failures: DLQ (KV list) + replay job; alert on 5xx.

Fraud trials: CAPTCHA on signup, rate-limit, email verification.

This addendum plugs directly into the existing PRD. If you want, I can also:

generate Stripe product/price scaffolding (JSON + dashboard checklist),

provide the Workers webhook + usage-record code stubs,

and a Figma-ready pricing page copy block with legal footers.

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 5s
Perfect — here are the three hand-off artifacts you asked for. They’re ready to drop into your repos / Stripe dashboard / Figma.

1) Stripe scaffolding (products, prices, metered usage)
You can create these with the Stripe Dashboard or via API/CLI. Below are idempotent API requests (replace placeholders in ALL_CAPS).

1.1 Products

Notes
• If you want Team as a bundle (e.g., 3 seats included), set transform_quantity or create a separate bundled price.
• Enable Stripe Tax in Dashboard → Tax → “Collect tax”.
• Create Coupons as needed (dashboard).
• Customer Portal: Dashboard → Billing → Customer Portal → enable “Update payment”, “Manage subscriptions”.

1.3 Checkout Session (server-side)
// createCheckoutSession.ts (Node/TS)
import Stripe from "stripe";
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET!, { apiVersion: "2024-06-20" });

export async function createCheckoutSession({ plan, seats, trial, coupon, tenantName }:{
  plan: "individual"|"team",
  seats: number,
  trial?: boolean,
  coupon?: string,
  tenantName: string
}) {
  const basePrice = plan === "individual" ? "price_individual_monthly" : "price_team_monthly";

  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    mode: "subscription",
    allow_promotion_codes: true,
    discounts: coupon ? [{ coupon }] : undefined,
    line_items: [
      { price: basePrice, quantity: Math.max(1, seats) },
      { price: "price_recommendation_metered", quantity: 1 } // creates subscription_item for usage records
    ],
    subscription_data: {
      trial_period_days: trial ? 14 : undefined,
      metadata: { tenant_name: tenantName, plan }
    },
    tax_id_collection: { enabled: true },
    automatic_tax: { enabled: true },
    success_url: `${process.env.APP_URL}/onboarding?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
    cancel_url: `${process.env.WWW_URL}/pricing?canceled=1`,
  });

  return { url: session.url! };
}
2) Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript) — webhooks, metering, recon
Assumes Workers (or Pages Functions), D1 (or Postgres) for tenant + usage shadow meter, and environment bindings:

STRIPE_SECRET, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET

D1_DB (or switch to Postgres client)

APP_URL, WWW_URL

2.1 Router & types
// src/index.ts
import { handleStripeWebhook } from "./stripeWebhook";
import { createCheckoutSession } from "./checkout";
import { postUsageRecord } from "./usage";
import { authGuard } from "./middleware";

export interface Env {
  STRIPE_SECRET: string;
  STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: string;
  APP_URL: string;
  WWW_URL: string;
  D1_DB: D1Database; // or replace with your DB client
}

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
    const url = new URL(request.url);

    if (url.pathname === "/api/public/checkout-session" && request.method === "POST") {
      const body = await request.json();
      const res = await createCheckoutSession(body, env);
      return new Response(JSON.stringify(res), { headers: { "content-type": "application/json" } });
    }

    if (url.pathname === "/api/stripe/webhook" && request.method === "POST") {
      return handleStripeWebhook(request, env);
    }

    if (url.pathname === "/api/meter/usage" && request.method === "POST") {
      // protected internal endpoint (e.g., called after a successful recommendation)
      const user = await authGuard(request, env); // validate JWT, get tenant_id
      if (!user) return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });

      const { request_id } = await request.json();
      const res = await postUsageRecord({ tenantId: user.tenant_id, requestId: request_id }, env);
      return new Response(JSON.stringify(res), { headers: { "content-type": "application/json" } });
    }

    return new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
  },
};
2.2 Checkout (Workers version)
// src/checkout.ts
import Stripe from "stripe";
import { Env } from "./index";

export async function createCheckoutSession(body:any, env:Env) {
  const stripe = new Stripe(env.STRIPE_SECRET, { apiVersion: "2024-06-20" });
  const { plan, seats, trial, coupon, tenantName } = body;
  const basePrice = plan === "individual" ? "price_individual_monthly" : "price_team_monthly";

  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    mode: "subscription",
    allow_promotion_codes: true,
    discounts: coupon ? [{ coupon }] : undefined,
    line_items: [
      { price: basePrice, quantity: Math.max(1, seats || 1) },
      { price: "price_recommendation_metered", quantity: 1 }
    ],
    subscription_data: {
      trial_period_days: trial ? 14 : undefined,
      metadata: { tenant_name: tenantName, plan }
    },
    tax_id_collection: { enabled: true },
    automatic_tax: { enabled: true },
    success_url: `${env.APP_URL}/onboarding?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
    cancel_url: `${env.WWW_URL}/pricing?canceled=1`,
  });

  return { checkout_url: session.url };
}
2.3 Webhook handler (verify sig, provision tenant, billing states)
// src/stripeWebhook.ts
import Stripe from "stripe";
import { Env } from "./index";

export async function handleStripeWebhook(request: Request, env: Env) {
  const sig = request.headers.get("stripe-signature")!;
  const rawBody = await request.text(); // important: raw body

  let event: Stripe.Event;
  try {
    const stripe = new Stripe(env.STRIPE_SECRET, { apiVersion: "2024-06-20" });
    event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(rawBody, sig, env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET);
  } catch (err:any) {
    return new Response(`Webhook signature verification failed. ${err.message}`, { status: 400 });
  }

  const stripeObj = event.data.object as any;

  try {
    switch (event.type) {
      case "checkout.session.completed": {
        // create tenant + map subscription
        const { subscription, customer, metadata } = stripeObj;
        const plan = metadata?.plan ?? "individual";
        const tenantName = metadata?.tenant_name ?? "Workspace";
        const tenantId = crypto.randomUUID();

        await createTenant({
          tenantId,
          tenantName,
          stripeCustomerId: customer,
          subscriptionId: subscription,
          planId: plan,
          status: "active" // or active_trial if trialing
        }, env);

        break;
      }

      case "customer.subscription.updated":
      case "customer.subscription.created": {
        const status = stripeObj.status; // trialing, active, past_due, canceled, unpaid
        await updateTenantStatus(stripeObj.id, status, env);

3.5 FAQ (5 items)
Can carriers see my data? No. Your data stays in your workspace.

Does this bind a quote? No. We provide recommendations; carriers determine eligibility and pricing.

What happens if I hit my limit? We continue service and bill overage at the plan rate. You can set a hard cap in settings.

Do you support health and life? Yes—both, with triage tailored to each.

Can I cancel anytime? Yes. Manage subscriptions in the Billing Portal.

3.6 Legal footers
By starting a trial you agree to our Terms, Privacy Policy, and DPA.

Stripe processes payments. We never store full card numbers.

4) Minimal DB (D1) schema addon (run once)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tenants (
  tenant_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  stripe_customer_id TEXT,
  subscription_id TEXT,
  plan_id TEXT,
  status TEXT CHECK(status IN ('active_trial','active','past_due','suspended')) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT (strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%fZ','now'))
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS usage_counters (
  tenant_id TEXT,
  month_key TEXT,
  recs_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, month_key)
);
5) Quick implementation checklist (dev)
 Create Stripe products/prices (IDs match code).

 Enable Stripe Tax + Customer Portal.

 Deploy Workers with STRIPE_SECRET, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, DB binding.

 Map webhooks → tenant provisioning + status updates.

 Call /api/meter/usage only after a successful recommendation response.

 Show usage meter in app header; near-limit + overage banners.

 Add “Billing” tab → open Customer Portal.

 Add pricing page with copy above; wire to /checkout-session.

If you want, I can also stub a React Pricing page and a Workers Pages Function variant.

Just generate a final, comprehensive .MD file for a developer. R2 object storage is preseeded with the underwriting docs and we ran autorag already (can run with diff models) so that API key for Cloudflare and striple keys can be in the env file for the app with any others
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a single comprehensive Markdown file you can drop into your repo (e.g. /docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md). It covers the full system: R2 seeding, AutoRAG, Cloudflare Workers, Stripe billing with metering, and environment setup.

# CarrierLLM — Developer Guide

_Last updated: 2025-09-16 · Owner: @jay_

This document describes how to set up, run, and extend the **CarrierLLM SaaS platform**.  
The system combines:

- **Frontend:** React app (chatbot + intake form + admin dashboard).  
- **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript).  
- **Storage & Indexing:** Cloudflare R2 + AutoRAG (already seeded).  
- **Vector Search:** Cloudflare Vectorize.  
- **LLM Inference:** Cloudflare Workers AI (fine-tuned 7B–13B).  
- **Billing & Auth:** Stripe (recurring + metered usage), Clerk/Auth0 for identity.  

---

## 1. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file (never commit to VCS). Bind values into Workers via `wrangler.toml`.

```env
# Cloudflare
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=acct_xxx
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=cfpat_xxx
CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET=carrierllm-docs
CLOUDFLARE_VECTORIZE_INDEX=carrierllm-index
CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY=carrierllm-ai
CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_AI_MODEL=carrierllm-finetuned-7b

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET=sk_live_xxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx

# App URLs
APP_URL=https://app.carrierllm.com
WWW_URL=https://www.carrierllm.com

# Auth provider (Clerk/Auth0)
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=clerk_xxx
Bind secrets:

wrangler secret put STRIPE_SECRET
wrangler secret put STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
wrangler secret put CLERK_SECRET_KEY
2. Storage & Indexing
Carrier underwriting docs are stored in R2 at r2://carrierllm-docs/<tenant>/<carrier>/....

AutoRAG has already chunked and embedded documents into Vectorize.

Updating docs:

Upload new file → R2 bucket.

AutoRAG pipeline detects → converts to Markdown → chunks → embeds → updates Vectorize.

Vector index refresh occurs within ~15 minutes.

3. Backend (Cloudflare Workers)
3.1 API Routes
POST /api/public/checkout-session → create Stripe Checkout session.

POST /api/stripe/webhook → handle subscription + invoice events.

POST /api/meter/usage → increment usage (1 recommendation).

POST /api/intake/submit → intake JSON → RAG retrieval → model → recommendations.

POST /api/outcomes → log carrier application outcomes.

GET /api/analytics/summary → placement & usage metrics.

3.2 Middleware
Verify JWT (Clerk/Auth0).

Lookup tenant.status in D1:

active, active_trial → allow.

past_due → warn + grace banner.

suspended → block with 402.

3.3 Usage Metering
Every successful recommendation → call /api/meter/usage.

Posts usage record to Stripe metered item (price_recommendation_metered).

Also increments local shadow counter in usage_counters table.

3.4 Stripe Webhooks
Handled events:

checkout.session.completed → create tenant row.

customer.subscription.created|updated → refresh entitlements.

invoice.payment_succeeded → set tenant.status=active.

invoice.payment_failed → tenant.status=past_due.

customer.subscription.deleted → tenant.status=suspended.

All events logged in billing_events.

4. Database (Cloudflare D1)
CREATE TABLE tenants (
  tenant_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  stripe_customer_id TEXT,
  subscription_id TEXT,
  plan_id TEXT,
  status TEXT CHECK(status IN ('active_trial','active','past_due','suspended')) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT (strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%fZ','now'))
);

CREATE TABLE usage_counters (
  tenant_id TEXT,
  month_key TEXT,
  recs_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, month_key)
);

CREATE TABLE billing_events (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  tenant_id TEXT,
  type TEXT,
  payload TEXT,
  ts TEXT DEFAULT (strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%fZ','now'))
);
5. Stripe Products & Prices
Provision once in Stripe:

# Individual Plan
stripe products create --id prod_individual --name "CarrierLLM Individual"
stripe prices create --id price_individual_monthly --product prod_individual \
  --currency usd --unit-amount 5000 --recurring interval=month

# Team Plan
stripe products create --id prod_team --name "CarrierLLM Team"
stripe prices create --id price_team_monthly --product prod_team \
  --currency usd --unit-amount 15000 --recurring interval=month

# Metered Recommendations
stripe products create --id prod_recommendation_metered --name "CarrierLLM Recs"
stripe prices create --id price_recommendation_metered \
  --product prod_recommendation_metered \
  --currency usd --recurring interval=month usage_type=metered \
  --unit-amount 5
6. Intake & Recommendation Flow
Frontend collects Q1–Q8 intake → posts to /api/intake/submit.

Worker:

Normalizes intake JSON.

Embeds query → Vectorize similarity search (top 6 passages per carrier).

Calls fine-tuned model with intake + passages.

Returns recommendations {carrier_id, program, fit_pct, reasons[], citations[], flags[]}.

Frontend displays ranked cards; agent can log outcomes.

Metering increments usage on successful response.

7. Frontend (React/TS)
7.1 Components
IntakeForm — guided form for Q1–Q8.

ChatPane — conversational interface.

CarrierCard — recommendation w/ % fit, bullets, citation popover.

OutcomeDialog — applied/approved/declined.

BillingBanner — usage meter + plan status.

AdminUploader — carrier doc management.

AnalyticsDashboard — placement & usage charts.

7.2 Auth
Clerk/Auth0 SDK for React.

JWT must include { sub, tenant_id, role }.

8. Public SaaS Signup
8.1 Marketing Site
Pages: Home, Pricing, Security, Docs, Legal, Enterprise.

Pricing toggle: Individual ($50/mo), Team ($150/mo), Enterprise (custom).

CTA: “Start free trial” → Stripe Checkout.

8.2 Customer Portal
Stripe Customer Portal enabled.

Features: manage payment, cancel, add seats, view invoices.

9. Billing Logic
Individual: 500 recs/mo included, overage $0.05 each.

Team: 3000 recs/mo, overage $0.03 each.

Enterprise: custom.

Overages billed via Stripe metered usage.
Grace period: 7 days after failed invoice before suspension.

10. Observability
Logs: input intake, retrieved snippets IDs, prompt, output (180 days retention).

Metrics: P95 latency, rec success rate, placement hit rate.

Alerts: webhook failures, metering reconciliation drift >0.5%.

11. Deployment
11.1 Local Dev
npm install
npm run dev
11.2 Deploy
wrangler deploy
11.3 CRON
Scheduled Worker every hour to reconcile usage counts vs Stripe.

12. Security & Compliance
TLS 1.2+, all data encrypted at rest.

PII minimized: only Q1–Q8 intake. No SSNs/medical records.

Role-based access (Agent, Manager, Admin).

Transparent audit: evidence packs exportable.

Disclaimer in UI: “Advisory only; final eligibility and pricing determined by carriers.”

13. Acceptance Criteria (MVP)
Intake → Recommendations ≤ 4s P95.

Every recommendation has ≥ 1 grounded citation.

Stripe trial → tenant provisioned ≤ 30s after webhook.

Usage increments match Stripe within 0.5% at invoice finalization.

Evidence pack export works for any request.

14. Next Steps
 Seed Stripe products/prices (IDs match code).

 Deploy Workers with env secrets.

 Integrate Clerk/Auth0 for auth.

 Build React intake & admin surfaces.

 Enable Customer Portal.

 QA: golden cases (clean intake, tobacco, major conditions, OEP gaps).

Great — here’s a dedicated style guide Markdown. It’s strategic (not just raw hex codes) so your design/dev teams understand the reasoning and can apply consistently. Save as /docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md.

# CarrierLLM — Style Guide & Design Tokens

_Last updated: 2025-09-16 · Owner: @jay_

This guide defines the **visual identity, tokens, and usage rules** for CarrierLLM.  
It is intended for both design (Figma) and frontend development (React/TypeScript).

## 1. Design Philosophy

CarrierLLM is a **B2B SaaS tool for insurance agents**.  
Our brand must balance:
- **Trust & Compliance** → conservative, professional.
- **Speed & Empowerment** → clear, modern, action-oriented.
- **Transparency** → grounded answers, citations, evidence.

**Style principle:** *“Modern fintech clarity with regulated-industry trust.”*

| `color.gray-100`| `#F5F7FA` | Backgrounds                              |
| `color.green`   | `#0EAD69` | Success badges, approval                 |
| `color.red`     | `#D7263D` | Error states, past-due banners           |
| `color.amber`   | `#F9A620` | Warnings, quota banners                  |

**Strategy:** Blue is primary (trust, clarity), neutrals support legibility, green/red/amber reserved for system status (approval, error, warning).

### 2.2 Accessibility
- Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1.
- Never use color alone to signal state → pair with icons or labels.

## 3. Typography

| Token             | Value                         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| `font.family`     | Inter, system-ui, sans-serif  |
| `font.size.body`  | 16px (1rem)                   |
| `font.size.h1`    | 32px / 2rem, weight 700       |
| `font.size.h2`    | 24px / 1.5rem, weight 600     |
| `font.size.h3`    | 20px / 1.25rem, weight 600    |
| `font.weight.reg` | 400                           |
| `font.weight.med` | 500                           |
| `font.weight.bold`| 700                           |

**Strategy:**  
Readable, professional, modern sans. Sizes tuned for agent desktops but responsive down to mobile. Headings bold, body neutral.

---

## 4. Spacing & Layout

- **Grid:** 8px spacing scale.
- **Container max-widths:**  
  - Marketing site: 1280px.  
  - App workspace: 1200px.
- **Component padding:** 16–24px internal.  
- **Line height:** 1.5 for body, 1.25 for headings.

---

## 5. Components & States

### 5.1 Buttons
- **Primary**: Blue background, white text.  
- **Secondary**: White background, blue border, blue text.  
- **Destructive**: Red background, white text.  
- **Hover**: +4% brightness.  
- **Focus**: 2px outline `color.primary-700`.

### 5.2 Banners
- **Info (blue)**: trial, upgrade nudges.  
- **Warning (amber)**: approaching quota.  
- **Error (red)**: payment failed / suspended.  
- All include icon + plain text + CTA.

### 5.3 Cards
- White background, subtle shadow, 8px radius.  
- Used for: Carrier recommendations, Pricing plans, Analytics panels.

### 5.4 Badges
- Rounded pill, bold text.  
- `% Fit` → green (≥80%), amber (50–79%), red (<50%).  
- Status (Active, Trial, Suspended) → mapped to palette.

---

## 6. Iconography

- Use **Feather icons** (or Heroicons outline set).  
- Pair icons with text in banners, CTAs, and warnings.  
- Examples: `check-circle` (success), `alert-triangle` (warning), `x-circle` (error).

---

## 7. Motion & Feedback

- Keep animations subtle (150–250ms ease-in-out).  
- Button presses: scale 0.98 on click.  
- Loading: spinner or skeletons, not flashy loaders.  
- Chat messages: fade/slide up 150ms.

---

## 8. Brand Assets

- **Logo**: wordmark “CarrierLLM” (modern sans).  
- **Favicon**: simplified icon (blue + white).  
- **Illustrations**: abstract workflow shapes, avoid cliché “robots” to maintain professionalism.

---

## 9. Usage Examples

### Primary Button
```css
.btn-primary {
  background: var(--color-primary);
  color: #fff;
  padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem;
  border-radius: 8px;
  font-weight: 600;
}
.btn-primary:hover {
  background: var(--color-primary-700);
}
Carrier Fit Badge
.badge-fit-high { background: var(--color.green); color: #fff; }
.badge-fit-mid  { background: var(--color.amber); color: #000; }
.badge-fit-low  { background: var(--color.red); color: #fff; }
10. Strategic Notes
Why blue? Blue signals trust and reliability (critical in insurance).

Why Inter font? Optimized for screens, wide support, professional feel.

Why 8px grid? Aligns with most component libraries and ensures consistency.

Why neutral cards? Keeps focus on recommendations (% fit, carriers), not UI chrome.

11. Future Extensions
Dark mode: flip neutrals, preserve primary blue (slightly desaturated).

White-label theming: allow enterprise clients to override color.primary, logo, favicon.

Multilingual support: ensure fonts render extended Latin + CJK gracefully.

Here’s a focused, accessibility-verified Tailwind setup you can drop into your repo. Save as /docs/TAILWIND_GUIDE.md.

CarrierLLM — Tailwind CSS Guide (with Accessibility Verification)
Last updated: 2025-09-16 · Owner: @jay

This document defines our Tailwind config, tokens, components, and contrast-verified usage rules. It aligns with the Style Guide and ensures WCAG 2.2 AA compliance for color contrast in UI.

1) Install & Enable Plugins
npm i -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer @tailwindcss/forms @tailwindcss/typography @tailwindcss/container-queries
tailwind.config.ts

import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'

export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}"
  ],
  darkMode: ['class'], // future-proofing
  theme: {
    container: { center: true, padding: '1rem', screens: { '2xl': '1200px' } },
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: {
          DEFAULT: '#1E6BF1',      // AA on white for normal text (4.74:1)
          100: '#E8F1FE',
          700: '#134BB0',          // AAA on white (7.89:1) – use for focus rings
        },
        gray: {
          100: '#F5F7FA',
          500: '#6E6E6E',          // AA on white for normal text (5.10:1)
          900: '#2E2E2E',          // AAA on white
        },
        green: '#0EAD69',          // USE BLACK TEXT (7.20:1) – white fails
        red: '#D7263D',            // White text is AA (4.96:1)
        amber: '#F9A620',          // USE BLACK TEXT (10.5:1) – white fails
        white: '#FFFFFF',
        black: '#000000',
      },
      borderRadius: { md: '8px' },
      transitionDuration: { fast: '150ms' },
      boxShadow: {
        card: '0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)',
      },
    }
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    require('@tailwindcss/container-queries'),
  ],
} satisfies Config
src/styles/globals.css

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* Prefer reduced motion */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * { animation: none !important; transition: none !important; scroll-behavior: auto !important; }
}

/* Focus-visible ring for keyboard users */
:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid theme('colors.primary.700');
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
2) Accessible Color Usage (Verified Pairs)
We computed WCAG contrast ratios (normal text ≥ 4.5:1; large text ≥ 3:1). Use these pairings:

Pair	Contrast	OK For
Primary #1E6BF1 on white	4.74:1	Buttons text, normal-sized text (AA)
Primary-700 #134BB0 on white	7.89:1	Focus rings, small text (AAA)
Gray-900 #2E2E2E on white	13.58:1	Body text, headings
Gray-500 #6E6E6E on white	5.10:1	Secondary text
Red #D7263D with white text	4.96:1	Destructive buttons/badges
Green #0EAD69 with black	7.20:1	Success badges, chips (use black)
Amber #F9A620 with black	10.5:1	Warning banners, chips (use black)
Gray-900 on Gray-100	12.65:1	Text on app backgrounds
❗️Do NOT use white text on Green #0EAD69 (2.92:1) or on Amber #F9A620 (2.00:1). Always pair those backgrounds with black text.

3) Tokens as CSS Utilities
You can alias our design tokens via Tailwind classes directly:

Primary CTA: bg-primary text-white hover:bg-primary-700

Secondary Button: border border-primary text-primary hover:bg-primary-100

Info Banner: bg-primary-100 text-gray-900

Warning Banner: bg-amber text-black

Error Banner: bg-red text-white

Success Badge: bg-green text-black

Card: bg-white shadow-card rounded-md

4) Accessible Components (Examples)

4.6 Form Fields (Accessible)
<label for="dob" class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">Date of birth</label>
<input id="dob" name="dob" type="date"
  class="mt-1 block w-full rounded-md border-gray-300 focus:border-primary focus:ring-primary" />
<p id="dob-help" class="mt-1 text-sm text-gray-500">Format: YYYY-MM-DD</p>
Uses @tailwindcss/forms for sensible defaults.

Always include a visible label; use aria-describedby for helper/error text.

5) Focus, Motion & States
Focus-visible only: we rely on native :focus-visible + ring classes for clarity.

Keyboard order: ensure DOM order follows visual order.

Motion: keep transitions at 150ms; respect prefers-reduced-motion.

6) Layout Patterns
Containers: container + max-w-screen-2xl for marketing, max-w-[1200px] for app.

Spacing: 8px scale — gap-2/3/4/6 for vertical rhythm.

Responsive: use md: and lg: for grid changes; cards collapse to single column at <md.

7) Testing Accessibility
7.1 Automated
axe DevTools (browser extension): no color-contrast violations; verify landmarks (header/main/nav/footer).

Lighthouse Accessibility score ≥ 95.

7.2 Manual checks
Keyboard: TAB through all interactive elements → visible focus, logical order.

Screen readers: ensure informative labels (aria-label, aria-live="polite" for banners).

Color-blind safe: states are not color-only — include icons/text labels (“Warning”, “Error”, “Success”).

8) Common Pitfalls (and Fixes)
White text on green or amber → fails AA. Use text-black on those backgrounds.

Low-contrast secondary text → stick to text-gray-500 on white (5.10:1).

Tiny text in buttons → keep button text ≥ 14px and weight 600 for legibility.

Icon-only controls → add aria-label="Close" etc., or visible text.

9) Example Page Frame
<body class="min-h-dvh bg-gray-100 text-gray-900">
  <header class="bg-white shadow-sm">
    <div class="container flex h-14 items-center justify-between">
      <a href="/" class="font-bold">CarrierLLM</a>
      <nav class="hidden md:flex gap-6">
        <a href="/pricing" class="hover:text-primary">Pricing</a>

</body>
10) Tailwind “Recipes” (Copy/Paste)
Primary CTA: class="bg-primary text-white hover:bg-primary-700 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-primary-700 px-4 py-2 rounded-md font-semibold"

Secondary CTA: class="border border-primary text-primary hover:bg-primary-100 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-primary-700 px-4 py-2 rounded-md font-semibold"

Usage Meter Bar:

<div class="w-full h-2 rounded bg-gray-100">
  <div class="h-2 rounded bg-primary" style="width: 64%"></div>
</div>
<p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500">320 / 500 recommendations</p>
Appendix A — Why these choices pass WCAG
Primary blue (#1E6BF1) on white: 4.74:1 → AA for normal text and buttons.

Dark primary (#134BB0) used for focus rings: 7.89:1 vs white → AAA, highly visible.

Status colors:

Green badge uses black text → 7.20:1 (white would fail at 2.92:1).

Amber warning uses black text → 10.5:1 (white would fail at 2.00:1).

Red error uses white text → 4.96:1, passes AA.

If you introduce new colors, check contrast at https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ or with axe.

If you want, I can also generate a Tailwind theme file (CSS variables) and a ready-to-use React component library scaffold (@carrierllm/ui) wired to these tokens.

You said:
Yes
ChatGPT said:
Awesome — here are two drop-in deliverables:

a Tailwind theme (CSS variables) you can share across apps, and

a minimal React UI library scaffold (@carrierllm/ui) using those tokens + accessible components.

They’re ready to paste into your repo. I’ve kept the code opinionated, small, and a11y-first.

1) Tailwind Theme (CSS Variables)
Save as /packages/theme/src/theme.css and import it once at the app root (before Tailwind utilities).
These variables mirror the STYLE_GUIDE + TAILWIND_GUIDE, with the same contrast-safe colors.

/* packages/theme/src/theme.css */
:root {
  /* Brand */
  --color-primary: #1E6BF1;         /* AA on white (4.74:1) */
  --color-primary-100: #E8F1FE;
  --color-primary-700: #134BB0;     /* AAA on white (7.89:1) */

  /* Neutrals */
  --color-gray-100: #F5F7FA;
  --color-gray-500: #6E6E6E;        /* AA on white (5.10:1) */
  --color-gray-900: #2E2E2E;        /* AAA on white */

  /* Status */
  --color-green: #0EAD69;           /* use black text */
  --color-amber: #F9A620;           /* use black text */
  --color-red: #D7263D;             /* use white text */

  /* Text */
  --color-white: #FFFFFF;
  --color-black: #000000;

  /* Radii / shadow / motion */
  --radius-md: 8px;
  --shadow-card: 0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,.06);
  --motion-fast: 150ms;

  /* Typography */
  --font-sans: Inter, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji";
  --font-size-body: 1rem;   /* 16px */
  --font-size-h1: 2rem;     /* 32px */
  --font-size-h2: 1.5rem;   /* 24px */
  --font-size-h3: 1.25rem;  /* 20px */
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * { animation: none !important; transition: none !important; }
}
Tailwind config wired to variables
Save as /tailwind.config.ts. It exposes the same palette as utility classes.

// tailwind.config.ts
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'

export default {
  content: ["./apps/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mdx}", "./packages/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mdx}"],
  darkMode: ['class'],
  theme: {
    container: { center: true, padding: '1rem', screens: { '2xl': '1200px' } },
    extend: {

          500: "var(--color-gray-500)",
          900: "var(--color-gray-900)",
        },
        green: "var(--color-green)",
        amber: "var(--color-amber)",
        red: "var(--color-red)",
        white: "var(--color-white)",
        black: "var(--color-black)",

}
Using the library in your app
Add workspaces in root package.json:

{
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*"]
}
In /apps/web:

pnpm add @carrierllm/ui
# or if local workspace: ensure pnpm/yarn workspaces link it automatically
Import theme + Tailwind in your app entry:

// apps/web/src/main.tsx
import '@carrierllm/ui/styles.css'            // optional if you add a styles aggregator
import '../../packages/theme/src/theme.css'   // ensure variables are present
import './styles/global.css'                  // Tailwind includes

import { CarrierCard } from '@carrierllm/ui'
If you want a single CSS from UI, create /packages/ui/src/styles.css that simply imports Tailwind preflight (optional) and documents expected theme import order. For most setups, apps own Tailwind build, and UI ships pure classed components (as above).

Optional: ship a minimal styles file from UI
/* packages/ui/src/styles.css */
@import "../../theme/src/theme.css";
/* UI itself has no Tailwind build; consumers compile Tailwind. Keep this file tiny. */
And add to package.json:

"files": ["dist", "src", "src/styles.css"]
Example page using components
// apps/web/src/pages/Recommendations.tsx
import { CarrierCard, UsageMeter, Banner } from '@carrierllm/ui'

export default function Recommendations() {
  return (
    <main className="container py-8">
      <Banner variant="info">Ready to review your client’s results?</Banner>

      <section className="mt-6">
        <UsageMeter used={320} limit={500} />
      </section>

      <section className="mt-6 grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2">
        <CarrierCard
          carrierName="Acme Life"
          program="Accelerated UW 500k–1M"
          fitPct={87}
          reasons={[
            'Allows 2 cardiac events if stable >12mo',
            'Build table up to BMI 33 at Standard',
            'Tobacco class applies'
          ]}
          onViewSource={() => console.log('open evidence')}
          onApply={() => console.log('mark applied')}
        />
        <CarrierCard
          carrierName="Beacon Health"
          program="Short-term"
          fitPct={34}
          reasons={['Short-term excludes pending surgery', 'Consider ACA route']}
        />
      </section>
    </main>
  )
}
Accessibility notes (verified)
Color contrast: All component pairings follow the table from the Tailwind Guide:

primary on white (≥4.5:1), gray-500 on white (≥4.5:1),

red bg + white text (≈4.96:1),

green/amber bg with black text (≥7:1 / ≥10:1).

Focus: keyboard users see focus outlines via :focus-visible and ring classes.

ARIA: Banners use role="status" (polite) or role="alert" (error). Usage meter exposes role="progressbar".

Motion: respects prefers-reduced-motion.

Build & publish
From repo root:

pnpm -w i
pnpm -w -r build   # builds @carrierllm/ui with tsup
Optionally publish the UI package:

cd packages/ui
npm publish --access public
(Or keep it private via Git/tagged installs.)

If you want, I can also add a Storybook preset for @carrierllm/ui with a11y/contrast addons and a few stories (Button, Banner, CarrierCard) so designers and devs can verify states visually.

Here’s a complete, drop-in Storybook setup with accessibility baked in. Save this as /docs/STORYBOOK_GUIDE.md. It includes config, addons, Tailwind wiring, and example stories for your shared UI lib (@carrierllm/ui) and app styles.

CarrierLLM — Storybook Guide (A11y-First)
Last updated: 2025-09-16 · Owner: @jay

This guide sets up Storybook v8 (React + Vite) with:

Tailwind + our theme tokens

Accessibility addon (axe-core)

Docs, Controls, Interactions

Sample stories: Button, Banner, CarrierCard, UsageMeter

Optional CI (GitHub Actions) + Chromatic

Assumes monorepo like:

/apps/web
/packages/theme
/packages/ui
and Tailwind configured per our Tailwind Guide. If your structure differs, just update relative paths in preview.ts.

1) Install Storybook
From repo root:

# Storybook core + React + Vite
npm i -D @storybook/react-vite@^8 @storybook/addon-essentials@^8 @storybook/addon-a11y@^8 @storybook/addon-interactions@^8 @storybook/test@^8

# Peer deps (if not already installed)
npm i -D vite typescript
Add scripts to root package.json:

{
  "scripts": {
    "storybook": "storybook dev -p 6006",
    "build-storybook": "storybook build",
    "test-storybook": "storybook test --watch"
  }
}
2) Project Structure
Create a .storybook/ folder at repo root:

.storybook/
  main.ts
  preview.ts
  manager-head.html        # (optional, for favicons, brand)
  preview-head.html        # (optional, for anything in <head>)
3) Config: Vite + Addons
.storybook/main.ts

import type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/react-vite'

const config: StorybookConfig = {
  framework: '@storybook/react-vite',
  stories: [
    // UI package stories
    '../packages/ui/src/**/*.stories.@(tsx|mdx)',
    // App-level stories (optional)
    '../apps/web/src/**/*.stories.@(tsx|mdx)'
  ],
  addons: [
    '@storybook/addon-essentials',   // Docs, Controls, Actions, Viewport, etc.
    '@storybook/addon-a11y',         // Accessibility (axe)
    '@storybook/addon-interactions'  // Play functions testing
  ],
  docs: {
    defaultName: 'Docs'
  },
  viteFinal: async (config) => {
    // Tailwind + PostCSS are picked up via your app config;
    // ensure postcss.config.{js,ts} is at repo root or project-level.
    return config
  }
}
export default config
.storybook/preview.ts

import type { Preview } from '@storybook/react'

// 1) Global CSS order matters: theme vars → app tailwind
import '../packages/theme/src/theme.css'
import '../apps/web/src/styles/global.css'   // imports tailwind base/components/utilities

const preview: Preview = {
  parameters: {
    layout: 'padded', // nicer default frame
    controls: { expanded: true },
    options: { storySort: { order: ['Intro', 'Primitives', 'Blocks', 'Pages'] } },
    // a11y addon defaults
    a11y: {
      // WCAG 2.2 AA checks via axe-core
      config: {
        rules: [
          // Example: enforce color-contrast everywhere
          { id: 'color-contrast', enabled: true }
        ]
      },
      options: {},
      manual: false
    }
  }
}

export default preview
If Tailwind isn’t picked up, make sure tailwind.config.ts and postcss.config.js|ts are discoverable. You can also create a .storybook/preview.css that @imports your theme & tailwind build if you prefer.

4) Example Stories
These live in packages/ui/src/... alongside components from the UI library scaffold I gave you.

4.1 Button.stories.tsx
packages/ui/src/primitives/Button.stories.tsx

import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react'
import { Button } from './Button'

const meta: Meta<typeof Button> = {
  title: 'Primitives/Button',
  component: Button,
  argTypes: {
    variant: { control: 'select', options: ['primary','secondary','destructive'] },
    size: { control: 'select', options: ['sm','md','lg'] },
    children: { control: 'text' }
  },
  parameters: { a11y: { disable: false } }
}
export default meta

type Story = StoryObj<typeof Button>

export const Primary: Story = { args: { children: 'Start free trial', variant: 'primary', size: 'md' } }
export const Secondary: Story = { args: { children: 'Talk to sales', variant: 'secondary' } }
export const Destructive: Story = { args: { children: 'Delete', variant: 'destructive' } }

export const KeyboardFocus: Story = {
  args: { children: 'Focusable', variant: 'primary' },
  play: async ({ canvasElement }) => {
    // Example interaction test: focus the button to verify outline (visual/manual)
    const btn = canvasElement.querySelector('button')!
    btn.focus()
  }
}
4.2 Banner.stories.tsx
packages/ui/src/primitives/Banner.stories.tsx

import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react'
import { Banner } from './Banner'

const meta: Meta<typeof Banner> = {
  title: 'Primitives/Banner',
  component: Banner,
  argTypes: {
    variant: { control: 'select', options: ['info','warning','error','success'] },
    children: { control: 'text' }
  }
}
export default meta

type Story = StoryObj<typeof Banner>

export const Info: Story = { args: { variant: 'info', children: 'Trial: 13 days left. Manage billing.' } }
export const Warning: Story = { args: { variant: 'warning', children: 'You’ve used 80% of your monthly recommendations.' } }
export const Error: Story = { args: { variant: 'error', children: 'Payment failed. Grace ends in 7 days.' } }
export const Success: Story = { args: { variant: 'success', children: 'Recommendation saved successfully.' } }
4.3 UsageMeter.stories.tsx
packages/ui/src/blocks/UsageMeter.stories.tsx

import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react'
import { UsageMeter } from './UsageMeter'

const meta: Meta<typeof UsageMeter> = {
  title: 'Blocks/UsageMeter',
  component: UsageMeter,
  args: { used: 320, limit: 500 }
}
export default meta

type Story = StoryObj<typeof UsageMeter>

export const Default: Story = {}
export const NearLimit: Story = { args: { used: 420, limit: 500 } }
export const OverLimit: Story = { args: { used: 540, limit: 500 } }
4.4 CarrierCard.stories.tsx
packages/ui/src/blocks/CarrierCard.stories.tsx

import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react'
import { CarrierCard } from './CarrierCard'

const meta: Meta<typeof CarrierCard> = {
  title: 'Blocks/CarrierCard',
  component: CarrierCard
}
export default meta

type Story = StoryObj<typeof CarrierCard>

export const HighFit: Story = {
  args: {
    carrierName: 'Acme Life',
    program: 'Accelerated UW 500k–1M',
    fitPct: 87,
    reasons: [
      'Allows 2 cardiac events if stable >12mo',
      'Build table up to BMI 33 at Standard',
      'Tobacco class applies'
    ]
  }
}

export const MediumFit: Story = {
  args: {
    carrierName: 'Beacon Health',
    program: 'Short-term',
    fitPct: 62,
    reasons: [
      'Short-term surcharge may apply',
      'Consider ACA if outside OEP'
    ]
  }
}

export const LowFit: Story = {
  args: {
    carrierName: 'Cypress',
    program: 'Clean Record Preferred',
    fitPct: 34,
    reasons: [
      'Program allows max 1 violation',
      'Pending surgery postpones underwriting'
    ]
  }
}
5) Docs Pages (MDX)
Create an intro doc that links to your other guides:

packages/ui/src/Intro.stories.mdx

import { Meta } from '@storybook/blocks';

<Meta title="Intro/Welcome" />

# CarrierLLM UI Library

This Storybook showcases the **accessible, contrast-safe** components used across CarrierLLM.

- Tokens & Tailwind guide: see `/docs/TAILWIND_GUIDE.md`
- Style guide: `/docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Marketing site spec: `/docs/MARKETING_SITE_UI.md`

All components pass **WCAG 2.2 AA** color contrast via our palette and use `:focus-visible` for keyboard users.
6) Accessibility Testing
Automated (axe)
Addon a11y runs axe checks automatically per story.

Ensure no color contrast violations appear for Button, Banner, CarrierCard, UsageMeter stories.

If you add new colors, verify against the table in Tailwind Guide or use WebAIM contrast checker.

Manual
Keyboard: TAB through interactive elements → ensure visible focus outlines.

Screen reader:

Banners use role="status" or role="alert".

UsageMeter exposes role="progressbar" with aria-valuenow/min/max.

Don’t rely on color alone: e.g., banners include icon/text; badges include text (“87% Fit”).

7) Running Storybook
npm run storybook
# open http://localhost:6006
Build static bundle (for hosting at e.g., Netlify/Cloudflare Pages):

npm run build-storybook
8) Optional: GitHub Actions CI
.github/workflows/storybook.yml

name: Storybook CI
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  storybook:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 20 }
      - run: npm i -g pnpm
      - run: pnpm -w i
      - run: pnpm -w -r build
      - run: npm run build-storybook
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: storybook-static
          path: storybook-static
9) Optional: Chromatic (Visual Regression)
npm i -D chromatic
Add script:

{ "scripts": { "chromatic": "chromatic --project-token=<YOUR_TOKEN>" } }
CI step:

- run: npm run chromatic
10) Troubleshooting
Tailwind styles missing in stories → ensure preview.ts imports theme.css then your app’s global.css (with Tailwind).

A11y color-contrast fails for green/amber badges → use text-black on those backgrounds (already set in components).

Focus rings not showing → verify :focus-visible styles exist and you aren’t resetting outline elsewhere.

Monorepo pathing → adjust stories globs in .storybook/main.ts to match your structure.

11) Done Checklist
 Storybook runs locally; Button/Banner/CarrierCard/UsageMeter visible.

 No axe a11y violations in default stories.

 Focus outlines visible via keyboard.

 Build artifact generated in storybook-static/.

 (Optional) CI publishes artifact / Chromatic runs per PR.

That’s it. This gives design + dev a live, accessible component catalog and a safe place to evolve the UI without breaking a11y or tokens.
