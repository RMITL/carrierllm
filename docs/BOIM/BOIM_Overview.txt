I've created a comprehensive suite of Product Requirements Documents for the Benefits Optimization Intelligence Module (BOIM) that integrates with your CarrierLLM system. Here's what I've delivered:
ðŸ“‹ Document Suite Overview
1. Master PRD - BOIM Core System

Complete product vision and business objectives
Integration architecture with CarrierLLM
User personas and journey mapping
Full functional requirements across all subsystems
Implementation roadmap with 4 phases over 12 months
Success metrics and KPIs
Budget estimation showing path to $9M annual revenue

2. RAG Subsystem PRD - Intelligent Matching Engine

Advanced vector database architecture for 500+ programs
Multi-modal document ingestion from federal, state, and carrier sources
Hybrid search combining semantic, keyword, and graph traversal
Knowledge graph for program relationships and stacking optimization
Continuous learning from application outcomes
Real-time eligibility validation with explanation generation

3. Profile Builder PRD - Intelligent Data Collection

Progressive disclosure form engine that adapts based on context
HRIS integration hub supporting 8+ major systems
Accounting system connectors for financial data
Privacy-preserving employee population analysis
External data enrichment (census, BLS, geographic data)
Smart validation with ML-powered anomaly detection

ðŸ”‘ Key Innovations
Bi-directional Intelligence: The system simultaneously builds profiles for insurance underwriting AND benefit optimization, creating compound value from each data point collected.
Zero Redundancy: Never asks for data already in CarrierLLM, automatically pulls from existing insurance qualification data.
Predictive Matching: Uses machine learning to predict eligibility before all data is collected, showing real-time opportunity counts as users complete profiles.
Stack Optimization: Intelligently combines multiple programs while respecting mutual exclusivity rules, maximizing total benefit value.
Automated Compliance: Tracks deadlines, monitors regulation changes, and alerts users to time-sensitive opportunities.
ðŸ’¡ Implementation Strategy
Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Foundation with 100 federal programs, achieving $10K average savings per client
Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Add state programs and ML matching, reaching $30K average savings
Phase 3 (Months 7-9): Full automation with application submission, targeting $50K average savings
Phase 4 (Months 10-12): AI optimization with custom LLM, achieving $75K average savings
ðŸŽ¯ Expected Outcomes

Identify average of $50,000+ in annual savings/grants per organization
Process 1M+ eligibility checks daily with <500ms latency
Achieve 85%+ qualification accuracy
Generate 40% increase in CarrierLLM client retention
Create new revenue stream of $500-1,000/month per client

The system is designed to be completely modular, allowing you to implement components independently or as a complete suite. The RAG database will continuously update as new programs are discovered, ensuring clients never miss opportunities.
